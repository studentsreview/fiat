{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Art 2","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Art 2 is designed for advanced art students as a portfolio skill-building class. Students will further their course of study by applying advanced concepts they learned in Art 1. Learning and improving on new art techniques will be a focus of this course, including further experimentation with graphite, charcoal, oil and chalk pastels, combination of ink and watercolor, color pencils, acrylic and oil paint. Students participate in direct observation studies (recorded in their sketchbooks) throughout the course as opportunities for skill building. Students create individual artworks based on their responses to historical, philosophical and cultural prompts. Meanwhile, they continue their exploration of artistic perception and art production. Students will build on previous experiences with design elements and principles, as well as knowledge of art movements to create quality works of art. Their cumulative work will be expressed in their final showcase portfolio.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"Art 2","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
