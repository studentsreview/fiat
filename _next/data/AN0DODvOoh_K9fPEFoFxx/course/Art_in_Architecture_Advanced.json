{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Art in Architecture Advanced","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Architecture 2 focuses on the study and application of the design process while infusing the history of American residential architecture (e.g., architectural language, meaning, structure, design trends). The emphasis is on expressing creativity in a visual form by (1) reviewing and applying the elements and principles of design; and (2) delving deeper into the inspirations, theoretical elements, and principles behind good design. Students follow the stages of the design process by completing a project from site analysis to a finished building design, creating it in 3D form.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Art in Architecture Advanced","block":"1","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Art in
