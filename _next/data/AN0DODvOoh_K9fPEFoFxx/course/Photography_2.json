{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Photography 2","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Students entering Photography 2 are expected to be experienced with a manual DSLR camera and with Adobe Photoshop editing skills. They learn to plan and execute longer and increasingly complex projects, resulting in a series of final images for each assignment. Students use advanced experimental Photoshop techniques to further manipulate their images for planned special effects. Project assignments become more conceptual, allowing students to illustrate more personal themes in their work. They are expected to refine their camera and editing skills so that they are at presentation level.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Photography 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"6","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"6","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Photography 2","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
