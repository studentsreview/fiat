{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Geology","department":"Science","description":"This is an introductory course on physical geology. Topics include plate tectonics, mineralogy, petrology, geologic time, economic resources, volcanism, earthquakes and hydrology. The course emphasizes Earth as a set of interconnected systems, dynamically evolving through time. Among these are the changing thermal regimes of Earth, conservation of energy, development, and evolution of life forms and the role of changing plate arrays in geologic time. Laboratory exercises include focused studies on classification of minerals and rocks, identification of predictable patterns in nature, demonstration of chemistry in understanding how and why certain elements combine to form minerals. Beyond introducing students to the general principles of geology, there are two broad goals of the course: (1) to develop an understanding of the geologic makeup and history of California; and (2) to develop the idea of Earth as a set of interconnected systems, dynamically evolving through time.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Geology","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"Geology","block":"4","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"Geology","block":"1","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"Geology","block":"1","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"Geology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"Geology","block":"7","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"Geology","block":"3","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"Geology","block":"3","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
