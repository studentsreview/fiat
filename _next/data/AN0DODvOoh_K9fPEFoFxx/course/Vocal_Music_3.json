{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Vocal Music 3","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Vocal Music 3 (Treble Choir) is designed for high/treble voices. Students in this course demonstrate previous vocal experience or completion of Vocal Music 1 and 2. Students will receive advanced instruction in aspects of singing, which include theory, terminology, ear training, sight reading, and advanced performance practices. Emphasis is placed on developing ensemble singing (i.e. balance, blend, and intonation). A more sophisticated understanding of the nature, structure, and meaning of music is accomplished through the study and performance of more advanced choral literature. Students are expected to attend all scheduled performances.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}},{"name":"Vocal Music 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Jason Chan"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
