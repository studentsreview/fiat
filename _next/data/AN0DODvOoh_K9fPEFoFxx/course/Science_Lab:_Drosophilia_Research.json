{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Science Lab: Drosophilia Research","department":"Science","description":"Scientific Research is a science course covering biotechnology, HPLC, biochemistry, microbiology, cell and tissue culture, genomics, cell and molecular biology, and related technology. The objective of this course is to enable students to apply their knowledge of different topics in biological sciences while working on their research project with a mentor from the local biotechnology/pharmaceutical and academic institution. Students increase their understanding of scientific lab techniques and skills by learning course content through lectures and labs in the first semester. During the second semester, students select a project from the topics covered in the first semester and design an experiment. While conducting their research, students demonstrate their ability to solve problems and think critically by modifying their lab methods and techniques to answer their question in different fields of study.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Science Lab: Drosophilia Research","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Anjana Amirapu"}},{"name":"Science Lab: Drosophilia Research","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Anjana Amirapu"}},{"name":"Science Lab: Drosophilia Research","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Anjana Amirapu"}},{"name":"Science Lab: Drosophilia Research","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Anjana Amirapu"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
