{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Ceramics 2","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Ceramics 2 builds upon the foundation established and developed in Ceramics 1 and allows students to explore in depth special interest areas of wheel throwing and hand-building. Students continue to study and use the Elements of Art and the Principles of Design while emphasizing conceptual art making, craftsmanship, creativity, and personal expression. Over the duration of this course, students create a series of projects that guide them through the exploration of their own personal identity. Each project is about the various aspects of their life experiences: identifying themselves, how they fit within their family unit, their culture, and eventually society. Students look at a variety of contemporary artists as models of how to address the concepts explored in each unit. Materials used include clay, glaze, underglaze, overglaze, ceramic stains and oxides.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"6","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"6","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"6","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"6","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"6","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"6","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}},{"name":"Ceramics 2","block":"6","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Ellen Reller"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
