{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Latin","department":"Foreign Language","description":"The AP Latin course focuses on the in-depth study of selections from two of the greatest works in Latin literature: Vergil's Aeneid and Caesar's Gallic War. The course requires students to prepare and translate the readings and place these texts in a meaningful context, which helps develop critical, historical, and literary sensitivities. Throughout the course, students consider themes in the context of ancient literature and bring these works to life through classroom discussions, debates, and presentations. Additional English readings from both of these works help place the Latin readings in a significant context.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Latin","block":"5","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"5","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"8","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"8","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"7","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"6","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"6","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"AP Latin","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
