{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Art in Architecture","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Art in Architecture 1 is a survey class designed to provide instruction in the fundamental concepts of architecture, engineering, sustainability, and aesthetics. The core curriculum emphasizes and integrates academic, practical, technical, and artistic skills. Students learn how to recognize and apply the elements and principles of design in 2D and 3D using the appropriate mechanical tools. Students study and develop models of ancient architectural structures from the bearing walls of Egypt to the arcuation of the Romans. They also explore, model and test various types of bridges to design their own original bridges that demonstrate function, structure, and beauty. They research and apply modern sustainability features in regards to energy, materials, and site. Students follow the stages of the design process in groups and individually to create scaled structural projects from beginning to end while executing architectural plans, elevations, isometric views, and models.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Art in Architecture","block":"1","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Julian Pollak"}},{"name":"Art in
