Students become active participants in the global art world, engaging with its forms and content. They experience, research, discuss, read, and write about art, artists, art making, responses to and interpretations of art.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Art History","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"AP Art History","block":"6","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"AP Art History","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"AP Art History","block":"6","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
