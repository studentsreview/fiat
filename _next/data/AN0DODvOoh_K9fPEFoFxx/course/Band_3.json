{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Band 3","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Band 3 allows intermediate musicians to further develop their instrumental technique and tonal control. They begin to independently monitor and modify their own pitch, diction, and interpretation. Musicians study more complex musical concepts, notation, and vocabulary, including modulations, cadences, and multiple types of scales. They create longer and more intricate compositions, improvisations, and arrangements of music. Students perform a diverse repertoire in a variety of performance settings.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"5","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"5","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"5","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}},{"name":"Band 3","block":"5","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Mitchell Wagner"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
