{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","department":"Foreign Language","description":"The AP Japanese Language and Culture course is designed to be comparable to college/university Japanese courses that represent the point at which students complete approximately 300 hours of college-level classroom instruction. Like the corresponding college courses, the AP Japanese Language and Culture course supports students as they develop the productive, receptive, and cultural skills necessary to communicate with native speakers of Japanese. The course prepares you to demonstrate your level of proficiency in Japanese across the three communicative modes (Interpersonal, Interpretive, and Presentational) and the five goal areas (Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities) as outlined in the Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century. The course aims to provide you many opportunities to develop your language skills while learning about Japanese culture and society.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}},{"name":"AP Japanese Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Naomi Okada"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
