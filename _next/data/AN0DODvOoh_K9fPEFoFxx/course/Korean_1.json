{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Korean 1","department":"Foreign Language","description":"Korean 1 is a yearlong, introductory course on the development and structure of the Korean language. The first year course offers the basic elements of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Students use orthography (writing system of Hangul) and phonology (sounds system) to understand and produce words and phrases in context. Students apply their knowledge of the written and spoken language in highly predictable common daily settings. In addition, they develop an appreciation of Korean customs and history appropriate for their course level. By the end of this course, students have the necessities appropriate for a first-year Korean language learner. This course aligns to the five categories of standards - content, communication, cultures, structures, and settings - and prepares students to demonstrate their Korean language proficiency across three communicative modes.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Korean 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"8","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Soo Park"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"1","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Choi"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Choi"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Choi"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Choi"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Choi"}},{"name":"Korean 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Choi"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
