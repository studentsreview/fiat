{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP European History","department":"Social Science","description":"AP European History is designed to be the equivalent of a two-semester introductory college or university European history course. In AP European History students investigate significant events, individuals, developments, and processes in four historical periods from approximately 1450 to the present. Students develop and use the same skills, practices, and methods employed by historians: analyzing historical evidence; contextualization; comparison; causation; change and continuity over time; and argument development. The course also provides six themes that students explore throughout the course in order to make connections among historical developments in different times and places: interaction of Europe and the world; poverty and prosperity; objective knowledge and subjective visions; states and other institutions of power; individual and society; and national and European identity.","AtoG":"A-History/Social Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Alexander Schwarz"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"8","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Alexander Schwarz"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"8","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"4","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"4","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"4","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"2","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Bell"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"5","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"7","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"7","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"1","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"3","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"3","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"AP European History","block":"6","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
