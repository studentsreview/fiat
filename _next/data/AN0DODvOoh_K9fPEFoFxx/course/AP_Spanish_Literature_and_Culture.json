{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","department":"Foreign Language","description":"The AP Spanish Literature and Culture course uses a thematic approach to introduce students to representative texts (short stories, novels, poetry, and essays) from Peninsular Spanish, Latin American, and United States Hispanic literature. Students continue to develop proficiencies across the full range of the modes of communication (interpersonal, presentational, and interpretive), honing their critical reading and analytical writing skills. Literature is examined within the context of its time and place, as students reflect on the many voices and cultures present in the required readings. The course also includes a strong focus on cultural connections and comparisons, including exploration of various media (e.g., art, film, articles, and literary criticism).","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Literature and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
