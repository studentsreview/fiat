{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"The AP Studio Art Program consists of three portfolio exams—2-D Design, 3-D Design, and Drawing—corresponding to the college foundation courses. Portfolios allow flexibility of coursework while guiding students to produce college-level quality, artistic investigation, and breadth of work. The Drawing portfolio addresses issues such as line quality, light and shade, rendering of form, composition, surface manipulation, the illusion of depth, and mark-making. Students' portfolios demonstrate skills and ideas developed, refined, and applied throughout the course to produce visual compositions. Students may choose to submit any or all of the portfolios. Portfolios are evaluated based on standardized scoring descriptors aligned with skills and understanding developed in college foundation courses.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"3","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"4","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"4","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}},{"name":"AP Studio Art: Drawing","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Kirsten Janssen"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
