{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Environmental Science","department":"Science","description":"The goal of the AP Environmental Science course is to provide you with the scientific principles, concepts, and methodologies required to understand the interrelationships of the natural world, to identify and analyze environmental problems both natural and human-made, to evaluate the relative risks associated with these problems, and to examine alternative solutions for resolving and/or preventing them.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP
