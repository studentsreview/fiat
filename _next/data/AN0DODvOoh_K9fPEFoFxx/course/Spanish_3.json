{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Spanish 3","department":"Foreign Language","description":"Spanish 3 is a continuation of skills from the second year, expanding on communicative functions in the three modes of communication. The class is conducted in Spanish, and students will have opportunities to exchange information, engage in conversations, and express feelings on more global topics such as the environment and travel. Learners are provided language-use activities that enable them to do the following: function in most informal and some formal settings, understand the main ideas and most supporting details in texts; produce simple narration, description and explanation; comprehend oral and written paragraphs; and produce strings of sentences. Students continue using the language to investigate and observe cultural practices and products and reflect on the perspectives that underlie them so that they will better understand, connect with, and engage with the global community in which they live. Students will use Spanish beyond the school setting and demonstrate real-life application by attending community events. They will show evidence of becoming lifelong learners by using Spanish for personal enjoyment and enrichment.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"1","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"David Lipman"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"5","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"1","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"David Lipman"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"5","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"1","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"5","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"1","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Benjamin Finch"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"5","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"8","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"8","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"8","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"8","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"6","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Jonathan Lombardi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Jonathan Lombardi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"5","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Jonathan Lombardi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Jonathan Lombardi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"3","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Jonathan Lombardi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"5","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Jonathan Lombardi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"6","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 3","block":"6","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
