{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Film as Literature","department":"English","description":"Too often, students \"turn off their brains\" when watching a film, believing that while books are meant for analysis, movies are meant only for entertainment, and therefore not worth thinking about. This course is designed to alter that perception and teach students how to analyze, discuss, and write about classic and modern film. Students learn to critically analyze the building blocks of film, including the mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing, and sound design. They then apply that knowledge to dissect various categories of film. This is a writing intensive course, in which movies are examined in the same way as literature in an English course.","AtoG":"B-English","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Film
