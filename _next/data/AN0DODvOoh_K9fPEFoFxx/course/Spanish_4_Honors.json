{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","department":"Foreign Language","description":"In Spanish 4 Honors, students continue to increase fluency in both the written and spoken language, build their vocabulary and oral comprehension, engage in discussions that require high-level thinking skills, and synthesize information drawn from a variety of authentic sources. This advanced-intermediate course is taught in Spanish. Students draw on sources in varying mediums to write critical and persuasive essays because they possess a deeper understanding of stylistic expression. They work to improve their command of academic language thus facilitating their ability to clarify, elaborate, and support their ideas, paraphrase content, and synthesize important points in both written and spoken Spanish. Their advanced command of the spoken language allows them to provide spontaneous responses.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"3","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"3","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Christian Ferrey"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 4 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
