{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Computer Science","department":"Computer Science","description":"AP Computer Science A is equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science. The course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design using Java language. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems. The AP Computer Science A course curriculum is compatible with many CS1 courses in colleges and universities.","AtoG":"C-Math","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[{"name":"Computer Programming"},{"name":"AP Computer Science Principles"}],"classes":[{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"6","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"6","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"2","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"6","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"2","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"6","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Raymond Chan"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"6","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Raymond Chan"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"1","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Raymond Chan"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Arthur Simon"}},{"name":"AP Computer Science","block":"6","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Raymond Chan"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
