{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Latin 3","department":"Foreign Language","description":"Latin 3 deepens the study of the Latin language and the classical culture. Students learn vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and culture through stories. They study Latin words and compare them with English words derived from Latin roots. Reading, translating, listening and writing are part of students' daily practice in order to develop vocabulary and understanding of the grammar and syntax. As students have developed a good understanding of the Latin language, they read and analyze classical prose and some poetry in original form.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Latin 3","block":"6","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"6","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"8","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"8","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"6","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"8","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"2","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"2","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 3","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
