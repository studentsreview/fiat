{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Environmental Science","department":"Science","description":"The purpose of the Environmental Science course is to give students an empowering understanding of the rapidly changing world through a multidisciplinary approach that includes earth science, biology, chemistry, and physics. As man's population increases, our impact on the environment requires vigorous study in order to design solutions that ensure the sustainability of the world's resources, including, but not limited to fossil fuels, alternative energy, agriculture, world's forestry, biodiversity, climate management, and water. The course also examines environmental economics and policy. Together these topics are aimed to encourage stewards of the planet and an informed future voting population. Understanding the world around us and our impact on the world develops students into critical thinkers and responsible earth inhabitants.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Environmental Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Erin Bird"}},{"name":"Environmental Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Erin Bird"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
