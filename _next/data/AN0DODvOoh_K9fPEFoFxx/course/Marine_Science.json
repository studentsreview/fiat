{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Marine Science","department":"Science","description":"Marine Science introduces students to the physical and biological \"world\" of the oceans. It is an ecologically based course that emphasizes the relationship between biotic (living) factors and abiotic (non-living) factors. Students examine the importance of the world's oceans' role on Earth's global climate and the scientific principles that govern organisms and their association with the environment. The course begins with the chemistry of water, plate tectonics, geography, ecology, and then embarks on an in-depth study of the diverse marine communities that can be found throughout the world. The class concludes with a study of the human impact on the sea: an analysis of global fishing practices, underwater mining, water pollution, ocean acidification, and global warming.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"6","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"6","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"6","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"6","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"5","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Anjana Amirapu"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Anjana Amirapu"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Freja Robinson"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Freja Robinson"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Freja Robinson"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"3","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Freja Robinson"}},{"name":"Marine Science","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Catherine Christensen"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
