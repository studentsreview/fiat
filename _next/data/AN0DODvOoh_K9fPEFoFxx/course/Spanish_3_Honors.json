{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","department":"Foreign Language","description":"Spanish 3 Honors is a continuation of skills from the second year, expanding on communicative functions in the three modes of communication taught at a faster pace than the general education counterpart. The class is conducted in Spanish, and students will have opportunities to exchange information, engage in conversations, and express feelings on more global topics such as the environment and travel. Learners are provided language-use activities that enable them to do the following: function in most informal and some formal settings, understand the main ideas and most supporting details in texts; produce simple narration, description and explanation; comprehend oral and written paragraphs; and produce strings of sentences. Students continue using the language to investigate and observe cultural practices and products and reflect on the perspectives that underlie them so that they will better understand, connect with, and engage with the global community in which they live. Students will use Spanish beyond the school setting and demonstrate real-life application by attending community events. They will show evidence of becoming lifelong learners by using Spanish for personal enjoyment and enrichment.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"4","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"8","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"8","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"6","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"6","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"8","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"3","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"3","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"1","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Maria Martinez"}},{"name":"Spanish 3 Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Cristina Billingsly-Ballbe"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
