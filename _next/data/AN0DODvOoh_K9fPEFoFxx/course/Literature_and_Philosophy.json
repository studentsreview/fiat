{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","department":"English","description":"Literature & Philosophy teaches reasoning and critical thinking skills through the examination of philosophy in literature and demonstrates how thoughts are acted out through daily action. This course is an introductory seminar to philosophical thought in fiction and explores how our metaphysical views, or our views on being, existence, and reality, shape our reality. Students examine how these metaphysical views are developed through logic, observation, and bias. Students develop stronger senses of self and activism through the practice of transforming profound thinking from conceptual to practical. They are exposed to various forms of literature including essays, novels, and poetry; students will complete reflection pieces, short stories, research papers, essays, and oral and visual presentations.","AtoG":"B-English","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"3","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"5","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Cathy Innis"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Cathy Innis"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"1","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Cathy Innis"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"3","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Cathy Innis"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"4","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"6","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"4","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"6","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"4","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"6","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"2","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"1","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Philosophy","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
