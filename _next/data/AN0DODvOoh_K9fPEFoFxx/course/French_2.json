{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"French 2","department":"Foreign Language","description":"French 2 is a continuation of French 1. Students acquire about 600-650 new vocabulary words. They begin more sophisticated conversations on thematic topics as they understand more vocabulary and grammar. Students continue to listen, respond, and practice French in simulated, realistic situations. Students have opportunities to perform the communicative functions of socializing, exchanging information, counting, expressing feelings and emotions, and persuading, while learning the language structures needed to perform these skills. Learners engage in critical thinking though analysis and comparisons of culture and language. Students also continue with French songs, participate in French heritage festivals, report on important French historical figures, and listen to intermediate-level podcasts. The grammar emphasis is on reflexive verbs, the compound past, and irregular past participles.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"1","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"1","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"1","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"3","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"5","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"5","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}},{"name":"French 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Edna Barakat"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
