{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Symphony Orchestra","department":"Visual Performing Arts","description":"Symphony Orchestra is an advanced level performing ensemble for strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. This class will focus on performing as a full symphonic orchestra. Students begin to independently monitor and modify their own pitch, diction, and interpretation. They evaluate performances based on more complex concepts and skills they learn, including modulations, cadences, and multiple types of scales. They employ more sophisticated terminology when discussing complex musical concepts and create longer and more intricate compositions, improvisations, and arrangements of music. Multiple opportunities to perform in different venues are provided both inside and outside the classroom, and solo and ensemble performances outside of the school day are encouraged.","AtoG":"F-VPA","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Symphony Orchestra","block":"2","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Esther Hollander"}},{"name":"Symphony Orchestra","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Esther Hollander"}},{"name":"Symphony Orchestra","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Esther Hollander"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
