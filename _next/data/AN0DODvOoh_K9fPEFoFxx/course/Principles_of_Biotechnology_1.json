{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","department":"Science","description":"Principles of Biotechnology 1 is a one-year course in the principles of biotechnology which will cover the history, present impact, and future potentials of this relatively new branch of science. The first part of the course focuses on the inheritance and physiology of genetic diseases and a review of Mendelian inheritance. The second part of the course focuses on key experiments in the history of DNA science as a model for studying the application of the scientific method. The third part of the course is on DNA chemistry and the structure and regulation of genes. The fourth section deals with the human genome and social, legal, and ethical issues engendered by the new technologies. The fifth section is an in-depth analysis of the immune system, AIDS, and impact and future potentials of biotechnology. Students learn basic genetics, molecular biology, biomedical research, and lab techniques.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"5","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"5","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"8","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"8","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Theodore Johnson"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"2","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"5","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"6","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"6","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}},{"name":"Principles of Biotechnology 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Bonnie Daley"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
