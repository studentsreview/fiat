The course introduces students to the systematic study of patterns and processes that have shaped human understanding, use, and alteration of Earth's surface. Students employ spatial concepts and landscape analysis to examine socio economic organization and its environmental consequences. They also learn about the methods and tools geographers use in their research and applications. The curriculum reflects the goals of the National Geography Standards (2012).","AtoG":"A-History/Social Science","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"4","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"8","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"1","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"3","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Magsanay"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Magsanay"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"1","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"3","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Magsanay"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Magsanay"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"3","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Magsanay"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"3","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Matthew Magsanay"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"6","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"7","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"2","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"6","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"7","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"6","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Rebecca Johnson"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"8","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Kay Petrini"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}},{"name":"AP Human Geography","block":"5","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Thomas Martin"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
