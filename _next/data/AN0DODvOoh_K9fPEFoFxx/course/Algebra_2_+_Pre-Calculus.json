{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","department":"Math","description":"This is the third course for high school students aligned to the Common Core State Standards. The course has a strong focus on expanding students' understanding of functions and generalizing function properties to transform a variety of functions, including: constructing and comparing linear and exponential models; transforming and modeling situations with a variety of function families (including quadratic, square root, absolute value); understanding the unit circle and trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, and the reciprocal functions), modeling periodic phenomena; working with polynomial and rational expressions and functions. In statistics, topics include understanding the properties of the normal curve, random processes, statistical experiments, and making inferences and justifying conclusions. This course covers additional topics beyond Algebra 2 to prepare students for AP Calculus, which include the following: trigonometric identities, composition of functions, piecewise functions, logarithmic functions, and inverse functions.","AtoG":"C-Math","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[{"name":"Geometry"}],"classes":[{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","block":"3","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Ernest Li"}},{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Ernest Li"}},{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Ernest Li"}},{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Ernest Li"}},{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Ernest Li"}},{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","block":"1","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Robert Tran"}},{"name":"Algebra 2 + Pre-Calculus","block":"1","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Robert Tran"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
