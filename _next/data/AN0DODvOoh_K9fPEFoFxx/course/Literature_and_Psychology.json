{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Literature and Psychology","department":"English","description":"Literature & Psychology explores the human psyche through exploration of \"villainous\" characters in literature (e.g., plays, short stories, novels) and film. Among others, students will read Cormac McCarthy, Arthur Miller, Stephen King, Truman Capote, and Janet Fitch as well as research on psychopathy and narcissism to develop a conceptual framework to examine motivation and character in various contemporary works. Students examine the social contexts these characters are presented in and analyze whether the archetypes are informed by social/cultural anxieties. Students read extensively, participate in Socratic Seminars, and build on their analytical writing skills through expansive composition.","AtoG":"B-English","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"3","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Cathy Innis"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"5","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Cathy Innis"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"8","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"2","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"5","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"1","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"4","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"5","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Jennifer Moffitt"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"4","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"5","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Bryan Ritter"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"8","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Jennifer Moffitt"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"1","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"3","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"4","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"2","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Jennifer Moffitt"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"8","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Jennifer Moffitt"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"1","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"7","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Samantha Yu"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"1","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Staci Carney"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"3","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Staci Carney"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}},{"name":"Literature and Psychology","block":"6","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Nicole Henares"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
