{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","department":"Foreign Language","description":"The AP Spanish Language and Culture course emphasizes communication (understanding and being understood by others) by applying the interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational modes of communication in real-life situations. This includes vocabulary usage, language control, communication strategies, and cultural awareness. The AP Spanish Language and Culture course strives not to overemphasize grammatical accuracy at the expense of communication. To best facilitate the study of language and culture, the course is taught almost exclusively in Spanish. The AP Spanish Language and Culture course engages students in an exploration of culture in both contemporary and historical contexts. The course develops students' awareness and appreciation of cultural products (e.g., tools, books, music, laws, conventions, institutions); practices (patterns of social interactions within a culture); and perspectives (values, attitudes, and assumptions).","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Victoria Maquinana"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"7","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Carole Cadoppi"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"5","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"1","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"1","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"3","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"1","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"1","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}},{"name":"AP Spanish Language and Culture","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"John Raya"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
