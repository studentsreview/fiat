{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Communications and Writing","department":"English","description":"In this course, students develop the skills necessary to meaningfully interact and effectively communicate in three modes: collaborative, interpretive, and productive. Through collaborative structures, students engage in textual analysis, strategy development, and extensive reading. Students participate in academic conversations, debates, formal speeches, and presentations. Students write to express their understanding and make arguments about texts. In their written and oral presentations, students are able to vary their language, style and argumentation based on their audience and identify when authors are doing the same. Ultimately, students attain the ability to independently and purposefully select texts which deepen their understanding of a particular personal, academic or career interest.","AtoG":"B-English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Communications and Writing","block":"4","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Adela Arriaga"}},{"name":"Communications and Writing","block":"4","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Adela Arriaga"}},{"name":"Communications and Writing","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Adela Arriaga"}},{"name":"Communications and Writing","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Jacqueline Moses"}},{"name":"Communications and Writing","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Jacqueline Moses"}},{"name":"Communications and Writing","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Jacqueline Moses"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
