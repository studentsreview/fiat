{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"Latin 1","department":"Foreign Language","description":"Latin 1 introduces students to the study of the Latin language and the classical culture. Students learn vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and culture through stories. They study Latin words and compare them with English words derived from Latin roots. Key concepts covered are noun-adjective agreement, noun-adjective declensions, pronoun use, different verbal tenses, and some use of the infinitives. Reading, translating, listening and writing are part of students' daily practice in order to develop vocabulary and understanding of the grammar and syntax. Students learn about the Classical culture through culturally related stories that are adapted, or modified.","AtoG":"E-Language other than English","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"Latin 1","block":"1","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"1","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"1","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"1","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Zeljka Sutilovic"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Maria Luisa DeSeta"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Undetermined"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"2","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"2","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}},{"name":"Latin 1","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Annie Huynh"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
