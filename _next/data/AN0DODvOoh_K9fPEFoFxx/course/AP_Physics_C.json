It is especially appropriate for students planning to specialize or major in physical science or engineering. The course explores topics such as kinematics; Newton's laws of motion; work, energy and power; systems of particles and linear momentum; circular motion and rotation; and oscillations and gravitation. Introductory differential and integral calculus is used throughout the course.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[{"name":"AP Physics 1"},{"name":"AP Physics 2"}],"classes":[{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"3","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"3","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"3","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Fall2018","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"2","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"3","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Fall2020","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"3","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}},{"name":"AP Physics C","block":"4","semester":"Spring2021","teacher":{"name":"Richard Shapiro"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
