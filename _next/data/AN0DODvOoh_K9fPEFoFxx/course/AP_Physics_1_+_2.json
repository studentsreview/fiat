{"pageProps":{"course":{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","department":"Science","description":"AP Physics 1 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course. Students cultivate their understanding of Physics through inquiry-based investigations as they explore topics such as Newtonian mechanics (including rotational motion); work, energy, and power; mechanical waves and sound; and introductory, simple circuits. The AP Physics 2 course is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course. Students cultivate their understanding of Physics through inquiry-based investigations as they explore topics such as fluid statics and dynamics; thermodynamics with kinetic theory; PV diagrams and probability; electrostatics; electrical circuits with capacitors; magnetic fields; electromagnetism; physical and geometric optics; and quantum, atomic, and nuclear physics.","AtoG":"D-Science","length":"Yearlong","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"4","semester":"Fall2015","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"5","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"5","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"5","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}},{"name":"AP Physics 1 + 2","block":"5","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Scott Dickerman"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
