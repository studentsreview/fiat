Through academic discussion and writing, students relate literary works and authors to the major themes and issues of their eras and evaluate the philosophical, political, religious, ethical, and social influences of the historical period. Students analyze the way in which authors used archetypes drawn from myth and tradition in literature. Additionally, students will engage in academic research and discourse using databases and other digital media sources.","AtoG":"B-English","length":"Semester","prerequisites":[],"classes":[{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Lorna Galang"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"6","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Lorna Galang"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015","teacher":{"name":"Audrey Stevenson"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"1","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Anne Guina"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"3","semester":"Fall2016","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"4","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Natalie Somerville"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"8","semester":"Spring2017","teacher":{"name":"Natalie Somerville"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"2","semester":"Spring2018","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"3","semester":"Spring2019","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"3","semester":"Fall2019","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}},{"name":"English and European Literature","block":"3","semester":"Spring2020","teacher":{"name":"Claire Puretz"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
