Labels each handout with your seat number and hands them out ONE BY ONE, rather than giving each row a stack and letting them self-distribute. Be prepared to stew in frustration as he fritters away class time handing out paper.\n\nParticipation matters! You will be expected to contribute a comment or something at least daily. Homework is also almost daily, and he will sign off on it at the beginning of class.\n\nSeconding, he is stingy with As. He is also a slow grader, but that does not translate to a lot of constructive comments.\n\nPrepares you well, essay-wise, for the AP exam, though his pacing through the material is terrible. Lots of prep for the rhetorical analysis essay in the fall (good for SAT essay!), but had not started prep for the synthesis/argument essays by the beginning of March. He does AP multiple-choice practice throughout the year.\n\nBonus: Easily distracted.
