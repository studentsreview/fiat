His tests are ALWAYS 4 questions and out of 100 points and he never really answers your questions. He responds to your question with a question. He is a chill grader and gives lots of partial credit. Do the HW he checks at the end of the semester. Do yourHW and you will be fine.Submitted by a student","rating":1.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Don’t take him.
