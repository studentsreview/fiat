Knows his stuff, so much so that he writes all of the course material - chapter notes, lecture PowerPoint, problem set, labs, etc. but be ware that you will work harder in his class and he will get annoyed when you slack. His ap bio student perform exceptionally well. Oh and he covers the entire curriculum in 1 semester and we spent much of the second semester reviewing and finishing all of the labs.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"WOW...coolest, most understanding, and nice teacher","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He reads these comments.

If there's nothing to do at the end of class, he'll ask \"How was your day?\" to the whole class. His tests are somewhat difficult but if you actually study, you will definitely be able to get an A. It's easy to keep a B. 25% grade for each: homework, labs/quizzes, tests, and finals.

Needless to say, he was easy at first. Pay attention and you can do well.

He does not explain anything out right and gets sidetracked very easily. He expects you to study 3-4 hours for a test. Come on. We go to lowell. We have other classes. The homework situation isn't that bad. It's hard to catch up if you miss a couple days. We do a lot of labs which is fun. If you want to learn something you should not take his class.","rating":4,"version":1}],"rating":4}},"__N_SSG":true}
