I took her for AP Principles of Computer Science and she barely taught anyhing, but that is ok because the AP test mainly requires logic. She's an easy A and you can use the block to go on the computers or finish homework for other classes. She's also very nice and understanding.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1}],"rating":4}},"__N_SSG":true}
