He yells at students, gets mad when students yell out answers, doesn't answer students when they raise their hands, just sits at his desk and writes assignments on the board. All we've done so far in the first 3 weeks is four chapter assesments, 7 maps of the world, and more dumb work.

His lectures are rants made of run-on sentences, disorganized ideas, and biased views. Take him, and you will learn from movies, online articles, and maybe, his horrible lectures.

You can get away with sleeping in his class, but he does ask you to take notes that he collects maybe 2 to 3 times a semester. pretty easy tests and easy enough class overall, he usually likes to cram in a lot in the last grading period because our class went so slowly which is kind of annoying.","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's a cool guy, he's boring but easy A.

He says horrible things that may be true but are upsetting, and unnecessary for learning. It's ok to sleep in class, or look at your phone(I wasted a lot of cellular data), just read the chapter the night before the test. The test questions are sometimes super random or confusing. He also takes like 100000 years to pass out tests, but I dig his style- that carhart jacket-beanie combo is cool.Submitted by a student","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Steele has a great sense of humor.
