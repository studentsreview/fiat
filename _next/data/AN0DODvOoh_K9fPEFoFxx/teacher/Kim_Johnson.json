I quite like her class, though I admit sometimes she doesn't know what she's talking about. But the amount of class time she gives us to self study helps makes up for my learning.

When approached on any issues you have with class, she immediately gets defensive and accusatory. She cannot grade. She picks favorites constantly.When she recognizes that she has done something wrong, she says something along the lines of \"Oh, I should probably do this that way, but oh well.\" Recently, she said in class that \"there shouldn't be one person in the room disseminating all the information.\" If i was not mistaken, that is supposed to be her job.","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Such an easy A as long as you try even a little, you get what you give. Yes she does sort of play favorites, so simply just be pleasant and nice. That's it. Not the best teacher, because her method of teaching is very unique, but effective nonetheless. It's like u read about the concepts in the book and come to class with a vague sense of the topic, and she'll go through it during class.
