She has you do a lot of group work while she does random stuff like fill up her water bottle for 30 minutes. Her only homework is reading the class book and writing your final essay.

Do the reading and really absorb the information, because she gives lots of reading quizzes as you go through a book. Your grade is based on these as well as a few tests, even tho the class is almost entirely discussion (which doesn't count for your grade btw, but stay involved because it helps on the tests).
