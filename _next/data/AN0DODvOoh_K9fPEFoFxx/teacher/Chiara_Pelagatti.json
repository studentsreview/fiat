She just goes through the textbook and doesn't really explain anything. The class in mostly particepation so you can get a good grade without getting A's on tests but if you really want to learn Italian you need to study.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i LOVEEEEEE MS. PELAGATTI!!!! She is such a darling and she always helps us when we need help understanding vocab, certain sayings, culture, food, projects, and written assignments. As long as you keep focused and pay attention, she'll love you. Try not to skip or disrupt the class, cause she wont like it. Study for her tests, and youll do just fine.

She's super chill, isn't very strict on homework or projects, and loves her students. As long as you listen to her lesson, you'll do fine. She's always willing to answer questions, and her class is relatively stress-free.

She is the sweetest, funniest, kindest teacher Iâ€™ve ever had. She genuinely cares about her students and loves to talk to us about her life, our lives, and anything else fun we have in mind. She is not the clearest at explaining grammar, but study from the book and you should be fine. Her projects are super fun, and we often watch movies in Italian. I higly recommend Prof. Pelegatti, and take her for all four years!Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1}],"rating":4.1818181818181825}},"__N_SSG":true}
