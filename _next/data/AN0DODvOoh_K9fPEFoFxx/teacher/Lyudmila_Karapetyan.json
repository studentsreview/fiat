You MUST take her for the first class that she teaches in order to have her teach. For example, she will teach Pre-Calc. 4/5 but not 6/7. Why? Because she only likes explaining stuff once.","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"she's nice but if you get an answer wrong on a test, you get no work points. hw random quizzes = easy points. unless you want to learn, DON'T take ms. k.. sadly enough she only had 1 accel class last semester (aka us), and apparently we got the lowest final scores. -____-\"","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"great teacher if you look past the accent. its not that big of a deal","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"she may have an accent, but i don't think it's that hard to understand, well, i did. her tests are pretty straight to the point, and she does most of the hard questions out for you.","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Horrible.

She goes a little fast, so take notes quickly. Also, her accent makes it hard to understand sometimes.

Just read the book. If you don't do a problem on a test her way, prepare to get the whole thing marked wrong. This will lower your grade by a metric ton. I highly discourage you to take her class.","rating":2.8,"version":1}],"rating":2.828947368421056}},"__N_SSG":true}
