Ms. Bajet barely teaches. We do a lot of reading in-class. But she doesn't guide us with analysis (which is crucial for sophomores). She seems lazy/preoccupied with personal issues. I only approached her once for help with an essay and she said she couldn't help me. (?!?!) She made me dislike English class very much. The only good thing was that we barely had any graded work so my grade stayed the same the entire semester.Submitted by a student","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i didn't learn anything in her class... i get confused with the assignments and every thing she assigns isn't helpful.Submitted by a student","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"doesn’t teach anything. grades based on her mood. complains about personal life ALL the time. gives random participation grade even though there are few participation opportunities. easy A if she likes you but you won’t learn anything at all.

Wrote like 1 or 2 essays the whole semester and didn't do much during her class. She makes you participate a little bit, but that was about it. If you take a while to reflect upon her, you'll see that she was an easy teacher. When she goes on about her life which takes up like 20 mins of class, it's pretty amusing. We watched movies which was pretty nice. If you need extra time for an essay, just ask her about it and she'll give it to you.Submitted by a student","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I think people are way too harsh with Ms B. She's really a nice person, but people can be pretty disrespectful in her class. If she asks you to put your phone away, do it, or she will start getting frustrated with you.She assigns very little work, and gives you a lot of class time to work on the few assignments. She also pushes deadlines back a lot.I personally think the class is pretty chill, but she definitely does have favorites.

You should take her especially 1st block because she is super chill. Wrote only 3 essays this semester and had a few homework here and there. Her class is interesting and slightly boring at times but overall I enjoyed her class better than Lo. Easy A if you have good handwriting for homework, B if you don't.
