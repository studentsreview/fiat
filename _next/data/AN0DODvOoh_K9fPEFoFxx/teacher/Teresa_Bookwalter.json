But ONLY if you like participating. I had her BOTH for drama and AP English. Drama -- Participate, and you'll do well. Just memorize your dialog, don't complain about it. She hates whiny people. AP English -- DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU HARD WORK. But she WILL prepare you for the AP and make the class fun, forcing people to show their views and improve their writing.

Can she teach? N.O. If you like trying to not use \"to be\" verbs, she's great. However, if you wish to actually learn to analyze...I suggest you find another teacher.

For the first month, the class had to read a book about making films. Then, when we actually made films, she was very specific and allowed very little creativity. She doesn't take no for an answer and you have to do everything she tells you perfectly. She'll threaten to flunk you if you don't sit on the floor, even though the room is full of chairs.
