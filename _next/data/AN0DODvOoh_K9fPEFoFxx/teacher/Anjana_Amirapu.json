She moves through material quite quickly in class, but if you go to her after school she takes the time to explain it to you. The tests are hard, but she provides study guides. Before big tests, she hosts study halls after school, in which students can ask questions or she explains different topics. Overall she is a very kind and good teacher and made biology a very interesting and fun subject to study.Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Although a lot of Ms. Amirapu's students complain, she is actually a very helpful and good teacher. She provides tons of resources for students to use for tests and quizzes, and study halls for finals. She is kind and lenient if you listen and pay attention. Her final was difficult, but if you pay attention and use the resources she offers, you are sure to get a high B/ low A.Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's ok. Her class is often just taking notes on presentations and lectures and she can go through material pretty quickly. She can be confusing, and you might have to ask questions during her off blocks or after school. Even then she doesn't help that much.Tests are kind of hard but she makes study guides. Uses the SFUSD BSCS textbook (rarely). Doesn't give homework every day; its usually just notes from the textbook, worksheets/packets, or class work. She's pretty nice and approachable.Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms Amirapu was a very good freshman biology teacher.

You don't really get that much homework, and when you do its usually just taking notes from the textbook or finishing up classwork. The tests aren't too bad as long as you study a little bit, she sometimes offers study sessions or test corrections. She's really friendly and approachable. The only cons are that she sometimes takes off points slight errors or very specific things.Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1}],"rating":4.166666666666668}},"__N_SSG":true}
