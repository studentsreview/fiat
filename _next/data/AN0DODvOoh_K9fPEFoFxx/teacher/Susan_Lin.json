She was super enthusiastic and made learning fun. She was very helpful outside of the classroom, whether it was homework related issues or something else. Her class was pretty manageable as well, I kept a solid A in her class without studying much just because she taught it very well. I didn't really have to study for the AP exam and I still got a 5. Just pay attention and do the homework (it doesn't take that long) and you'll get an A. One of the best teachers at Lowell for sure.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Super relatable. Loved lectures with her slideshows.

I honestly never had a teacher that taught so well, and if I did have a good teacher, he or she would be SUPER hard.

She is the nicest, most down to earth person. She is a very young teacher so she is able to connect with her students well. For AP Psychology we left class five minutes early almost every day. I had her when it was her first year teaching, so it was a learning process for us both which helped us a lot in group discussions. Choose Ms Lin first if you have the chance.

She made AP Psychology my favorite class of the day, with her contagious enthusiasm. I was never bored in class. I never read the book because her lectures were so concise yet so informative.

A few times she had us write up an evaluation of the class after taking a test. She would ask us how long it took us to do her homework and other homework in general. She has lectures presented in PowerPoints with recommended notetaking in notebooks or binder paper. Plays games the day before tests as review. Mainly multiple choice, some essays.

She listens to you when you have something to say, and is always willing to offer you help on studying for tests!

She does not assign too much hw and her tests are usually pretty easy. Although not a big deal, she often misunderstands or misinterprets what people mean when they raise their hands answer her questions. Her class can be really boring because it is mostly taking notes for her power points. She moves at a slightly fast pace and her teaching is not very in depth. She is pretty chill.
