She doesn't really care what your doing unless you are also doing your work. Her tests are really easy, and most of the worksheets she uses are from the internet. Also, she makes you do a lot of internet activities, and some of them are really fun.

Needless to say, worksheets can be boring, and don't really prepare you for tests. She is pretty nice and has a generally relaxed class. Easy A if you turn in all the worksheets and do okay on tests.
