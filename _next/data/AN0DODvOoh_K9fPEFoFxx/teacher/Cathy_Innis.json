She explains the concepts pretty well and she repeats herself several times. That way you really can't forget it. The only bad thing is that you might be in a room with 25 other sleepy kids. Most students get pretty sleepy by the end of 19,20. Homework is based on completion. She gives out pop quizs but they are easy as long as you read the stuff she assigns. MC questions can be tricky though, but the essay questions are really easy","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had her for Lit and Phil, awesome class!

Her tests aren't that hard either. Homework isn't very much and isn't very hard. After you read the books, like Othello, she showed us a video of it. I wanted her for Expo but she was already filled up when I got there.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Innis is the best. She's sweet and funny and is actually aware of what goes on around school and her students. If you really talk to her, you won't regret it. The work load wasn't too bad, and you go over everything in class. Her tests are a little tricky, especially the True or False.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Decent homework, it'll help you on the tests. Really good teacher, best English teacher I've had so far. Her true/false questions are tricky, so know the details.

She has gotten way more exciting than last year when I took her class. She's extremely fair in grading and the workload she gives is manageable. She's really nice and takes her classes out on field trips to watch plays.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Took Innis for 10 Gr Eng 2. She is pretty easy, and most of her tests are objective. Only had to write 2 or 3 essays. The True and False on her tests are pretty tricky, but tests are only like 40-50% of your grade. I would say it is an easy B, and it isn't very hard to get an A. You just have to try a little harder.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"not too much hw, tests are eay but some Qs are tricky. 10th grade english is not boring, went to see plays. she is clear and is a good teacher. easy B","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"One of the best english teachers at lowell.

She is nice and I would take her again. :)","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She is a very good teacher. She definitely knows what she wants to do with her class and how to teach it to us. Her instructions are clear and most definitely do everything she can to help us succeed. I am taking her Expos class and it is one of my most favorite classes. Homework is pretty easy, but it does help you write a little better if you put the effort into it. I reccomend her and I would take her again if I could.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Definately one of the good and sane english teachers of Lowell.

She tends to kind of grade you according to her opionion on the matter (expos), but you'll still get a good grade if you're a good writier. She also shows films and lets you read what you want sometimes, it's pretty cool. One of the better english teachers at Lowell. It's too bad we stole her from thurgood XD","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"yep, she accused me of cheating on a hw assignment (told me that I copied off the overhead when we went over it in class). She only refunded my points because she was in a hurry to go and didn't want to argue her point, which actually had no evidence to it anyway...","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had her for literature philosophy. She lectures somewhat slowly and repeats herself from time to time, which makes her easy to understand, but boring. It can be hard to stay awake in her class, and there are always 1-2 people sleeping, but she almost never calls anyone out for sleeping (I don't know if she is being nice or just doesn't notice). Little homework, just reading. Easy B, slightly harder A, because her quizzes and tests can be tricky.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Innis is a tough grader and she is not one to argue over whether it could be right when she thinks it is wrong. Just speak up in class to get good participation and do all your work then you will achieve a B, if you actually try hard then you will get an A.She is a good teacher. She tries to help","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I absolutely adore having Ms. Innis for her AP English Language class.

Pretty easy A, but I really hate her tests - ambiguous True/False questions","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Compared to the other 4 English teachers I've had at Lowell, her class is less exciting than watching paint dry. I'm not saying to avoid her in the arena, but there are much more fun English classes. Her homework assignments can get annoying after a while too.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"shes really nice. very sweet. pretty easy to get a B but just work at that A and you'll probably get it.
