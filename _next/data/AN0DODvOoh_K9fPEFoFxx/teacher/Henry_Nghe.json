He teaches the material very thoroughly, and gives you lots of practice. He assigns a lot of work, so be ready to work your ass off for his class, but he is very lenient about turning in late work. You can turn in work 2 months late and still get full credit! He's a really good teacher, as he's been in the profession for a long time. He always asks if anyone needs help, so don't be afraid to ask him! If you ask him, he will always explain it thoroughly to you. Tests can be a bit hard, but if you pay attention in class, you will do good. You can ask him questions about math, or anything in general, and he tries his best to help you. He doesn't pick favorites, and is super amazing overall. ","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-03T03:00:05.989Z","text":"Had him for geometry and algebra 1, he’s a really good teacher. I learned a lot from his class and he is always willing to help if you don’t understand, his tests could be hard sometimes but it isn’t that bad.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-02T04:13:00.860Z","text":"Really friendly teacher that you can always ask for help from, and he makes sure to explain everything he's doing. Assigns daily homework based on what he taught that day but is super lenient on when you turn it in. As long as you pay attention, you can get a relatively easy A.

He's really friendly towards the students and will help you in his free blocks. He's doesn't rush like other teachers. He assigned a lot of khan academy, but since khan academy changed its mastery system somewhat, it's easier to complete his khan academy assignments. He only checks hw after several weeks, so you can do it later if you don't have time. Not too much work. He's also really understanding. His spirit animal is a mouse!Submitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Nghe does a lot of Khan academy so if you don't want to spend hours trying to get 5 right in a row don't take him. His tests are pretty easy if you pay attention but sometimes you don't have enough time. Uses schooloop a lot.Submitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He is a pretty ok teacher? The only problem I have is the fact that he assigns a TON of khan academy... so not only do you have to pass on the tests, but you also have to complete and master all of the khan academy assignments. It becomes annoying.Submitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Chill and good teacherSubmitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Great teacher who is willing to help anyone in his class who needs help. He has a study hall time every week you can go to. He assigns larger amounts of homework but gives you lots of time to complete it. Gives lots of khan academy which can get tedious. Tests aren’t to hard if you pay attension in class. Last finals don’t count much (15%) and he adds midterms to dilute the score and lower the final’s impact.Submitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1}],"rating":4.6875}},"__N_SSG":true}
