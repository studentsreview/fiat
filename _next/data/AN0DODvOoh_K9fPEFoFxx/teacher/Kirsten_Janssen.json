She was extremely supportive to everyone and taught different art styles and painting techniques. but i also felt she was favored students that were natural artists and would pick their work to display in the art wing.

She's a really nice teacher that actually wants you to learn about art. She goes over your piece with you and gives you ideas/suggestions.

Ceramics became one of my favorite classes right away. I never found her to be stingy with A's, but she does like to make you think outside of the box. And I feel that she grades on effort and creativity, not as much as the actual piece of work. I took one semester with the other teacher, and no way does she compare to Ms. Janssen.
