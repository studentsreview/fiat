He really makes you think outside the box. To him, it's really not important whether you know the book material or formulas, but whether or not you can apply them and make them your own. His tests make you think. Construction work is based on a computer program, and he uses it to help us visually see some of the concepts we learn in class.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"his tests are very challenging but hes a good teacher. u get a lot out of the class and he notices when you are tryin to improve in his class.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"For his first geo H class, Cohen taught pretty well. Most of the tests were obtainable A's(although there was 2 that had some questions which made everyone get B/C's on them). Has good curves if everyone does bad on tests, and it's an obtainable A if you put effort into it. Lots of group work, and not a lot of lectures, so if you're a lecture-note type of person, i wouldn't recommend him. Incorporates online geo programs/normal day situations into some thought up problems, which is cool.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i thought that i needed to take morehen in order to get a 5 on the ap, but it turned out that cohen prepared us well enough too. and my senior grade didn't suffer unlike those who had morehen.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"For Geo H, most class days, it seemed like he just ignored us, just assigning us something in the beginning of class and then going off to his computer. I started off with an easy A, but my grade slowy crawled down to a B. I guess this is what I get for not doing my homework (rather I study other subjects), but I wish that Cohen actually went over the material so Iâ€™d be more motivated to work and later find out if I completed the problems correctly.

He knows what he's talking about, but likes to assign group work so we figure things out for ourselves rather than telling it to us. I think I \"hit the wall\" in this class, but I DID learn a lot.

The only bad thing is on some tests he gives a problem or question that calls for extreme thinking and piecing together a lot of information.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"cool teacher, helps u outside of class if u need help","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Freakin awesome.

If I had the chance to pick Hoffman in the first semester, I would have made that decision no doubt. TAKE HOFFMAN!!!!

He does not collect homework and usually does not go over them, pretty easy B. He grades almost all on tests. Tests are not easy and not too hard, pretty fair. Semester started quite easy and got harder along the way for me.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Really knows his stuff. Has a lot of teaching experience. Has a grand plan. He teaches students of all ages, and uses very simple, understandable language in class. He manages to make things laidback while teaching you a way of thinking that really helps you understand the concepts and how they fit into calculus. tests are hard when there are proofs, but pay attention and its obvious if the proof will be tested. otherwise, tests involve tying concepts together and understanding the big picture.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He DOES NOT TEACH. Every day in his class comprises of solely working on worksheets and learning from your table mates. Does not give lectures or clear presentations. Very confusing to follow and learn from. Tests do not reflect curriculum or matters learned. If you love yourself, take Mr. Hoffman.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr Cohen is pretty cool for Geo Honors. Some people complain that he doesn't teach, and that he wants you to figure things out yourself. Thats partially true, but that's what I liked about his class. He's always willing to help you though if you ask. Tests are manageable, sometimes hard, but geo honors is pretty tough already. Really chill on homework too. Take him.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"His tests really test your understanding of the subject matter. I reccomend him for Geo H because if you pay attention in class, you will be apt to do well.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Prepares for the AP well.

He has a Math PhD and has taught college and done serious programming stuff - but does not make an issue of it. He puts effort into his classes, there is a good bit of group work and fewer \"oh look, new subject\" lectures, but every day something new comes up and it all flows well. It is the first math class that I have had at LHS that I looked forward to every day. Sadly, nobody knows what \"Cohen\"'s class S'06 will consist of. I wish him well.
