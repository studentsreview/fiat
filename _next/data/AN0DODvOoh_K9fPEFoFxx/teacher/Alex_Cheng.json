You should always take notes in his class any study them before tests. His class is not very engaging and we basically do practice problems and problems in the textbook  everyday. He isnâ€™t the best at explaining and it can be difficult to understand unless you already know about the subject.","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-06T17:31:18.004Z","text":"It is critically important that you take notes in this class but he makes note-taking very easy. I enjoy this class a lot, mostly because Mr. Cheng is the nicest guy and pretty much just wants everyone to have a good time and feel supported. He has a shy, nice, dorky energy that makes the class super fun. In the beginning, I struggled in his class a little bit because Mr. Cheng is a fan of his 'spicy' problems. 'Spicy' problems are problems that you will only be able to solve if you are that one kid who is smart enough to teach the class. He is fair about grading things like that though and has lightened up on the spicy problems. There really isn't an excuse to have less than a B in this class (putting aside extenuating circumstances). He provides all the possible practice and resources needed to succeed and makes himself available for students to ask any one-on-one questions at any time.","rating":4,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-05T01:55:58.841Z","text":"Super nice and down to Earth. He always prepares you well for the finals and never gives too much homework.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-02T20:47:18.269Z","text":"Mr. Cheng is really chill and nice. If math is a pretty easy subject for you- I would definitely recommend him. But if you struggle with math a little- probably go with another teacher. Hes not very engaging during class and just assumed everyone is understanding what he is saying. I had to work really hard at home to try and understand the material. Tests are HARD- way more advanced then classwork.
