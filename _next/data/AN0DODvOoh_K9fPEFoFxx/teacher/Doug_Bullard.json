He is very nice and tries to keep everyone happy. He cares about R.O. kids a lot and is very knowledgeable. If you need great counseling, stop by his office and he will always find some time for you. He is always smiling and never gets mad or upset. However, the difficulty of the class will always depend on your Company Commander, but it's usually very easy. Students can relax in the class and just escape from all the stress of Lowell during class. J.R.O.T.C. is definitely my favorite memories of Lowell High School.

He does his best to keep everyone in the program happy, and he makes sure that everyone has a voice. He always gives you advice when you ask him for help with something, instead of giving you a direct order. He has changed the lives of many students, and he is an amazing person.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's a really cool person!

For example, for a few weeks one semester, I was probably the only platoon leader in the battalion who could read a map, but he didn't seem too stressed. Still, he made a big impact on my time at Lowell and even now, several years later, I still remember his teachings. I guess with Col. Bullard, you get more out of him when you put more effort in.","rating":4.6,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"amazing.","rating":4.6,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"What a nice man.

All Mr. Bullard does is publish them. You can do whatever you want if you suck up to him, although that includes dedicating your life to the program, including staying until 10pm. He'll dislike you if you're part of a team he doesn't like. He will lock you in his office to get what he wants and doesn't stop talking. He cares more about his image than hazing.
