He assigns you a ton of work and eventually it is your peers who grade them. If you don't have any friends in that class......:(. His tests are ok, a lot of the questions are common sense, but some questions are totally random and unrelated to what we've learned. During distance learning, he assigned us 4 hours of hw a week. On the other hand, when he actually gives lectures (very rare), they are very informative and interesting.","rating":2,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-08T07:04:21.042Z","text":"ever since distance learning started I have been so unmotivated to learn in his class. all he does is post the assignments with multiple worksheets/videos attached (very disorganized btw, don't even know where to start). he keeps on pushing video conferences off to a later date, not like it would help with the learning process anyways. everything is graded by your peers and he just inputs the scores into synergy. he's a nice person don't get me wrong but teaching is just not for him.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-07T05:21:32.302Z","text":"Mr. Dowd is soooo nice, but he just isn't good at teaching. He assigns tons of extra work outside of class and expects you to learn more about the topic on your own. The tests are extremely difficult and don't cover anything he teaches. He is lazy and unwilling to create study guides or make things clearer for his students. Everything is graded by peers and not him. You are expected to have every single assignment(including extras) in your notebook. The notebooks are checked every grading period. He expects you to know everything about biology before you come into class, which is extremely unrealistic.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-06T22:17:08.172Z","text":"I thinks he’s a good person with good intentions. However, VERY disorganized and relies on you to ask other students for help instead of actually teaching. Most big projects are peer graded. One positive thing is that if you’re respectful and ask nicely, extensions aren’t hard to get.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-05T23:39:48.866Z","text":"Definitely has good intentions, and is an overall nice guy. However, if you don't prefer to work independently and don't catch on things quickly, he's probably not the best teacher for you. He's a bit unorganized, but is really nice and you can see he wants to be a better teacher (but doesn't know how). I did have an easy time in his class, but my classmates will object.","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-02T16:30:30.097Z","text":"Had him for biology and it was disappointing. You have to be very self motivated and timely to not consider dropping out because you have to self learn and turn in a cacophony of slide notes, video notes, annotations and notebook work a few times a week on Google Classroom. No test/lab reviews, peer graded, uses instruction from else where online because he's 1) dealing with stress 2) sick 3) pursuing phD.  ","rating":2,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-04-20T07:29:09.522Z","text":"this man can not teach. all he does is give you articles to read and expect you to understand them and the tests have nothing to do with the study guides. expect butt loads of CERs and projects and your grade depends on your peers. blames you for the work HE loses. most of the time he'll be on his computer or phone during labs that HES supposed to be supervising","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2019-12-15T08:18:40.001Z","text":"Worst experience I have ever had with a science teacher. He is extremely unorganized and tends to blame us when he loses our work. I have had my grade dropped multiple times because he misplaced my work and gave me a 0. He inputs grades on the last day and tells us he is too stressed when he just does it to himself. If he graded assignments and didn’t leave them up all until the last minute, he would be fine. He also tells us how he knows school is stressful yet gives us the most homework. He pulls it straight from the textbook and nobody understands what he rambles on about half the time. He should not even be a teacher. Very disappointed that teachers like these even cease to exist.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2019-12-15T08:09:29.838Z","text":"He is a pretty bad teacher if u ask me. Had him for biology and he barely shows up to work. Constantly sick and gives us multiple projects to do with a day notice only. He even has us turn in work he did tell us about. His tests are pretty hard since what he talks about in class is not related to what’s on the test whatsoever. He does not teach and prefers us to give us a stack of worksheets rather than explaining what we should be doing. Very unclear about instructions and has lots of favorites. You need to self study A LOT if u want to learn. Overall, terrible experience in his class. Try to drop his class if you get him. ","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2019-12-15T07:08:38.174Z","text":"Our first assignment on the first day of school was to write an essay ABOUT HIM. He literally collected the papers and dumped them so there was no point at all to have stress over it on the first day. He doesn’t allow us to ask questions and gets mad if we do. Takes months to input a grade. Is ALWAYS ABSENT either because he is on vacation or he has a stomach ache. Blames us for his stress and never answers emails. If you ever get him just drop out.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2019-12-15T07:02:24.264Z","text":"He is a lazy teacher. NONE of the projects or assignments are graded by him instead classmates but the thing is that he raises suspicion when you get full scores so he drops your grade because of that. Gives us unreasonable failing grades but never changes mistakes. He always tells us to forget about the fail and move on. Spends the WHOLE CLASS BRAGGING ABOUT HOW HE GOT INTO IVY LEAGUE. NOTHING we “learn” is on the tests. Never teaches because we either read from a book or google. Gives us huge projects on units we haven’t learned yet due  the next day. He has lectures but skips every slide and says you don’t need that because you know already. Cares about the look of your notebook more than the info you have. Favors people and curves their grades.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Definitely has favorites!!!

He expects us to know things that we've never learned in class, borrow all the resources(presentations and worksheets) online but the tests are nothing about those resources he used during class. Don't really do much in that class, and the activities he considered as fun are useless and boring. If you want an easy A take him, but you're probably not gonna learn anything from that class. first year teaching in lowell so can't really expect that muchSubmitted by a student","rating":2.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I have had Mr. Dowd for less than a week and he's already the best teacher I've ever had. He's understanding, fun, fair, and feels just as much like a friend as a teacher. He's really smart, and makes every class so interesting!

Well.. my first impression of him was awfully wrong. He seems like such a nice person at first but he's a horrible teacher. He's extremely bad at teaching, nothing he says makes any sense, assigns loads of busy work, EXTREMELY UNORGANIZED, and messes up experiments that we do (\"on purpose\") so badly to the point that when i write the lab report my conclusion is just explaining all the mistakes that he made.Submitted by a student","rating":2.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"For chem,mostly self-study. In class, we don't do much other than correct hw or do labs sometimes. Tbh not very clear when we ask questions and will most likely reply with \"this is a good opportunity to use your outside resources to help you find answers!\" Although we dont do much in class, he expected us to know beyond what we learned in class n puts them as test questions. Assigns a lot of hw sometimes for weekends. It's his 1st yr. at lowell, so not v organized, but not his 1st yr teaching...Submitted by a student","rating":2.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had him for Biology 1 and at first, he seemed like a pretty good teacher. nice and friendly, makes some bad jokes tho. but then, he starts playing favorites and he never really explains instructions well. tests are easy if you self-study because he stuff he teaches in class is not exactly what’s on the test. not very good at explaining concepts. his experiments are lowkey boring.Submitted by a student","rating":2.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"my student has him as a bio teacher and she does not like him at all.

Most of the content on the tests is stuff that he hasn't taught. He is a nice person, and is pretty cool overall, but is confusing and doesn't teach much.

Definitely recommend dropping his class immediately if you get him as a teacher. Expects you to know things he doesn't even talk about and gives you really hard tests. His activities in class are also very boring and he gets really frustrated over little things. He's never clear on any work we are doing and is always messing up on things.

On one hand it was nice to have a energetic and clearly passionate about science teacher for a change but he is very unorganized and can be unclear on his instructions.
