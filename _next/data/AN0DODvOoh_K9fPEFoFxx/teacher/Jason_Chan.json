Usually only spends half the class time teaching VM 1 and the other half with TAs planning out VM3 stuff, but  still learned good tips on singing (I had no experience). VM3 has a superb reputation though and he spends a lot more energy on that so that would make the investment worth it.","rating":4,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's really funny","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"laid back, chill teacher. had him for Piano Lab 1 - super easy A. he's helpful and really nice. even if you're late or you skip he won't ask questions.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Funny but doesnt teach so well.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's really laid back, haha, practically even more laid back than a student.

Just make sure you go to the concert, of course. Uses music textbook at the beginning of class every day. Then you stretch and warm up before you practice singing. Only classwork, so never any homework. You aren't supposed to use your phone or do homework, though, since it's like PE--you need to participate.Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"very easy. all u hav to do is show up and participate. he doesnt give any tests except a 10 question final which is very easy.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"The way he talks to kids when he's sarcastic is unbearably annoying.

His class is really easy and he is nice to all of his students, especially those who put in effort.
