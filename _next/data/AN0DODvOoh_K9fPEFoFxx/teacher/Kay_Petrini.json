Super easy and you watch a lot of movies but it gets kinda boring. You do learn some stuff and barely have any hard assignments. Also basically lets you go on your phone. Plus she usually accepts late work for full credut.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-11T02:25:26.875Z","text":"Easy A and really nice, take her if you wanna chill in class and take it easy (if it’s a regular class), but I have her for APHUG and I feel that she didn’t prepare me that well. A lot of self studying and teaching but she’s very approachable and helpful when you have questions. ","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-07T20:24:12.129Z","text":"She's actually a very easy teacher. As long as you do the homework, which isn't very much, and do the reading you're supposed to, the class is a very easy A. I once failed a test but still ended with a 98 in her class, so homework really helped to keep my grade up. Her final was also very easy (and I'm bad at history), it's just information pulled from the textbook and things that were gone over during class.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-05T06:14:28.505Z","text":"i would definitely recommend if you want an easy A in her class but most of the class is watching some sort of film or video, going through slideshows, or a lecture. she’s super nice and she’s lenient to SOME people when they use their phones in her class. just be one of her favorites and you are good to go. her homework load is not that bad she occasionally gives homework and it takes a maximum of 10 minutes to do.","rating":4,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-05T03:10:07.837Z","text":"good class, easy but you also learn, I would recommend ","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-05T01:52:39.649Z","text":"Super easy class! You get out what you put in. As long as you pay attention, it's an easy A and you can learn a lot. There also is a lot of movie days! ","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-04T19:31:00.227Z","text":"Easy A teacher. Uses her own website as an agenda of her course, and uses outside sources to relate to the material (i.e. news, movies, etc.).","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-03T02:39:39.978Z","text":"She was really easy but you will be fucked on tests because her tests are based off the assumption that you actually learned the material.

She nice tho so its good","rating":2,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-04-07T22:01:47.960Z","text":"I took her World History class. She is a very chill teacher and loves having movie days.
