We read a couple thought-provoking books this semester, which I enjoyed immensely. Her test are extremely simple, as long as you pay a minimal amount of attention in class you will do fine. She doesn't seem to have favorites, just try not to say anything controversial.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Adela is a great reader, and she will often point out stuff that will make you think. She's not too harsh of a grader.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's a really nice teacher and if she likes you you'll be able to get along with her. There's a lot of writing but her tests aren't hard and she's pretty chill.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"A very kind teacher and one who grades pretty easily. Has interesting exercises and really helps with creating essays. Cares about her students and the well-being of them.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's super nice, and like a chill hippie :) Not too many essays. Had us read like 3 or 4 books throughout the entire year, and the tests on them were super easy. Would recommend, but don't be too disturbing in her class :)Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She will be the easiest A you've ever had in Lowell. On the other hand, you will not learn anything new. Her lessons are all over the place and there isn't enough time on a topic to actually \"get it\". She expects you to write essays but she doesn't spend enough time and doesn't go in depth into teaching you how to improve them. Take her for the easy A.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She wasn't here for 3/4 of my English 2 semester... BUT, she's very chill and would make a great ethics teacher cause all she talks about is race and liberal/controversial topics (which is very interesting but can be overwhelming for some). People either hate or love her. Very little writing assignments, all reading/discussing in class, and tests are easy as long as you read the books!Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I've had her twice now for freshman English, and then sophomore English. Although her class is extremely easy, to the point that you barely have to the work to get an A, she'll still give you really interesting books to read and is an excellent writer. If you go to her for feedback on essays, she will make you a much better writer.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1}],"rating":4}},"__N_SSG":true}
