As a native speaker, my \"tongue\" is good but my PinYin sucks, as do my characters. Mr. Danforth is amazing at teaching. He teaches way better than all of the other teachers and he makes it fun, amusing, and enjoyable. Is a big fan of skits - improved speaking skills and are funny. He also divulges his mind once in a while, which is always fun. His tests can be a bit of a logjam for most, but you can survive. YOU MUST TAKE HIM. Easy B, pretty easy A. He's also the Dragonboat coach.","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's pretty good at teaching Chinese even though he learned it only for several years.

Mr. Danforth is funny and nice. I learned tons of things from his class. His exams are not difficult. As long as you take notes and work hard, you will get an easy A in his class. Also, make sure to not messed up with the tones. He really cares about it and if you messed up during dialogue reciting, you will lose 0.5 points. I highly recommend you to take Mr. Danforth. You will learn tons of things in his class! And you'll love his class!Submitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"had him last year!

But, I noticed he actually knows what he's doing to get all of his students prepared for whatever is coming. He cares about each and every student's education and their situation. He also throws out some funny life stories related to the topic. You can learn from strokes to tones and much more if you really want to be serious to learn basic chinese.

He ain't cool. 2nd semester... He begins to be cool! Mr. Danforth is the teacher who will really care for his students. He pushes you with hard work, but is it worth it? yes! Homework is light, but long and sometimes hard for beginners. tests are ok-easy. He started to tell his students what to study the day before the test which is REALLY helpful! But be warned, he might surprise you with a word you may have forgotten to write!
