Really likes food. A bit rude at times.Submitted by a student","rating":3.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mediocre teacher. Knows his subject relatively well --- you'll learn the basics of what you need to know in his class --- but not much beyond that. Curves his tests a bit, which is nice. Talks a lot about stuff that's unrelated to the subject, almost as if he's trying to fill time. Gives a lot of projects with unspecific requirements and then grades them really harshly, especially presentations. Pretty easy A.Submitted by a student","rating":3.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Makes class fun with bad hilarious jokes. Extremely effective at teaching.
