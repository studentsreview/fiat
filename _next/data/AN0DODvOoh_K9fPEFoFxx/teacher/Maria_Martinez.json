It's an easy class and she was very kind and helpful. She lets you retake all of your tests, which is great. The only problem is that she got behind on the curriculum a bit.Submitted by a student","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"oh my god Ms. Martinez is literally the kindest and sweetest teacher I've ever had. I had her this year for AP Spanish Lit and even though it was her first year teaching it she did such a great job. She is so understanding and I would defintely recommend her to anyone.Submitted by a student","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She is the best Spanish teacher I can ever ask for. Honestly her class is super fun and not that stressful. You actually get to learn and practice Spanish without it going against you or hurting your grade. She is super sweet and kind and OMG I just love her personality. Her tests are easy, you can retake it multiple times, even if you get a B you can retake it. I would totally recommend her and she is one of my favorite teachers!

Honestly hated Lowell but she made things a little better. We need more teachers like her! <3Submitted by a student","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"amazing and sweet! Rescued me from 2 years with Collins and the other short dude (was so bad I already memory wiped his name) and made me actually like Spanish. She actually takes time to drill grammar into you and gives you lots of ways to practice. So kind and cute, talks about her husband and kids fondly. Tries to make class fun and took some of the drawl of going to a 7:30am. She's a keeper, Lowell. A true mom.Submitted by a student","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Shes a cool teacher. She teaches pretty well and has tests/quizzes somewhat often. Shes REALLY nice and is okay. Its an easy A. For the Day Of The Dead, she let us watch a \"scary\" video and gave us \"pan dulce\" ( a Mexican bread) and it was really nice. Have fun with her 👍🏽Submitted by a student","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Um, can Ms Martinez teach all of my classes? She's a very easy A plus an amazing teacher. She lets you retake all tests, essays, and quizzes. Also she's SO nice. The only reason I'm not taking AP Spanish next year is cuz she's not teaching it. Like after her I don't want anyone else. Also her videos are life, especially that cooking one in the forest 😂😂😂Submitted by a student","rating":4.7,"version":1}],"rating":4.7}},"__N_SSG":true}
