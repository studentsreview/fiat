She mainly focuses her teaching on grammar which is pretty important but at the same time i found difficult. Her quizzes are easy but her tests are not. i didn't like how she randomly calls on people to participate, but i guess she has no choice when no one does.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms.Liang is one of the best Chinese teachers you can take.

She's pretty funny and will help you if you need it. If you're a complete beginner for Chinese, you might need to ask her more questions because a lot of the kids in the class prob already know a little Chinese.

I had her for this past year for Chinese, and absolutely loved it!

Watch out though, some test questions are extremely opinion-based, esp true or false questions! yet, she grades them in an unfairly black and white way. She hardly assigns hw and helps you review before the final. Has some skits but does not even grade them. She also calls on people randomly. If possible, sit off to the side of the front so she doesnt call on you.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She is pretty nice with grading, only taking like 0.1 - 0.5 points off your test.

She is a great teacher who will do a lot to meet her student's needs. Her class is really easy and she is a super nice person, so nice that I think some people take advantage of her, like that Spanish teacher who always comes in during our class which is rude.
