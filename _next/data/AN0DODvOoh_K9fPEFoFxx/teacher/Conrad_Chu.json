Great guy dressed up for spirit week (has more spirit than most students), good humor, super nice (tells you to stop talking and get off your phone in the nicest way possible), REALLY helpful (you can ask 82262627272 questions and he'll help you out). Tests are ehh looking over at the book helps clear things up, but his lectures are short and ok.

They're way harder than the problems he assigns us for homework and in class. There aren't many problems, but they're long and complicated expressions. And tests are worth 80% of your grade and he grades so slowly so we have like 1 test PER grading period so if you bomb a test because you've had a bad day then you're getting a D on your report cardSubmitted by a student","rating":4.6,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He actually teaches the material and explains it when you ask for help.

Pretty small HW load (I get most if not all of it done during class), goes over what's going to be on tests, good at explaining, short lectures, really friendly/approachable, lots of partial credit on tests AND curve! His tests are not bad at all, mostly bc of his easy grading (compared to other math teachers). Do the homework (it REALLY helps), ask questions, take minimal notes and u have an A.Submitted by a student","rating":4.6,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Great teacher.

He is super sweet and curves your tests and such, and seems to really want to help all of his students succeed. He makes mistakes during his lectures sometimes, so it's a bit confusing but mistakes happen and he's just such a great person.
