Our only homework were two group projects. We did have tests which are a huge portion of your grade but if you read the book you're fine.

Grades extremely hard on essays and tests, but she doesn't give them back to you so you can't see or know what you did wrong. You don't know why you got a bad grade, but you know you did. Haven't been able to learn from a single test yet. Speaking of her tests, they're ridiculous. She asks about the most subtle things in the story, instead of the actual main ideas and themes like english teachers should do.","rating":3.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's a pretty chill teacher and there's not much homework.
