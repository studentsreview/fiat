You can take your notes to quizzes and tests so as long as you take a lot of notes, you'll pass every quiz.

I had a lot of fun times. Toward the end of the year, there are days when you get a tiny bit of work and the rest of the block free. There's a lot of presentations, but he barely grades them. Very little HW. However, you can tell that he knows what he's talking about when he lectures. He's a nice, chill person and will joke around with the class. While everything is easy, I still learned a lot and we aren't behind the other classes.

All his tests are open note, class is super chill (you can eat and go on your phone whenever) and he usually ends like 10 min early and we can just hang out. Hardly ever assigns hw, never assigns hw over the weekend, quizzes on each chapter are never more than 12 questions, the only hard test was the final. Just be sure to take real thorough notes for that one! Very easy A, would recommend UNLESS you want to do an AP history later on... I don't think he prepares you well","rating":3.3,"version":1}],"rating":3.2999999999999994}},"__N_SSG":true}
