She talk a lot about grading harshly but everyone always gets a ton of bonus points at the end of the semester that should put you into an A if you spent some effort.

The little quizzes and labs may seem easy, but you have to put some effort into them. And her tests are pretty hard, only ten questions that covers 4-6 chapters and she moves very quickly, 1-2 chapters a week. Her final was easy second semester-it was a board game.

Probably one of the only teachers at lowell that actually teachers for you to learn.

The way she teaches is not even like lectures its more like stories or talking to you as a person not just a student.
