The only reason she would get mad at you is if you talk a lot while she's talking. Her tests are OK if you study hard, but sometimes they have stuff we didn't go over. She starts out by talking almost fully in Italian a month after the year starts, which got pretty confusing. Very easy A if you pay attention and take lots of notes.Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"mostly good teacher, she used to live in Italy so she is very knowledgeable.

However, she is very confusing! For the beginning of the year, she spoke way too much in Italian. She also gives little tests that are vert hard, and are often more complex than the material you learned. However, she is so nice about grades! She gives extra credit if you ask that can bump your grade up a whole letter. aLso, the final is verbal ,and she is an easy grader on thatSubmitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She is an amazing person and really just wants us to learn.

I had her for Italian 1, and she genuinely cares about her students. She only gets mad if you talk while she's talking. Will help you if you ask. Italian is her native language, so she knows what she's teaching. Would take her again if I could, and I highly recommend her.Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. De Seta is an awesome teacher. When you need it help she'll help you. She talks in italian and then in english, which really helps you learn, or it at least it helped me. Her exams aren't that hard and your grade is kinda of how much you are trying and learning in the class.Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1}],"rating":4.3}},"__N_SSG":true}
