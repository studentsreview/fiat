The reviews that were said was made by people who are obnoxious, insensitive, halfhearted, spoiled sociopaths. pls do not take their comments seriously. They have clearly never dealt with any stress in their lives and they don't know how to handle it. And kate if youâ€™re reading this, I know you wrote one or these reviews bc that just who you are.

Do the extra credit, if she says extra credit, do it! She likes students who are unique. Do not say, \"I'm the captain of the football team\" she can care less! Her test/quiz for me are hard. Her essays and stories are generally easy. learning Shakespeare was not as bad as i thought it would be. She is good at grading, bad at teaching for the test so study study study!","rating":3.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Bottom line is if you want an easy A, go elsewhere, but if you want to have fun and learn a lot take her class.","rating":3.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Oh, Henares, where do I even start? Her class is lackluster, unorganized, and bsed. She just lectures about things that have nothing to do with the course. You don't even learn how to write in her class. Instead, you write an essay about a random topic that she interests herself in and she grades it. If you don't get a B or somethin you can revise it. If you want an easy teacher with pretty much no work and can put up with her, take her.Submitted by a student","rating":3.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I think that people are way too hard on Ms. Henares. She's actually a really cool person if you bother to listen to her, and she's always passionate about the things she talks about. She is a bit moody, but she honestly cares about her students. She caters to student's individual needs, whether that be for concerts or books that she thinks we would enjoy. I know most people won't agree with this, but her class was by far my most interesting one, and I really think you should give her a chance.Submitted by a student","rating":3.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's a cool teacher who explains things very well, and she has great 'test review' sheets so you know what to study for.
