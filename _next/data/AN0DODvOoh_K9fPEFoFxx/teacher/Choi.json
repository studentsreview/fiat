Learning Korean is so much more easier with her and she goes easy on everyone. The only thing is we didn't get to know each other in the start because we had no teacher and everyone was so boring. I can tell because I have lunch next to Korean and I hear no one talking in there. Overall Korean with Ms. Choi is so fun and she does not give hw - if she does, she doesn't check. You should choose Korean as a class :) ","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-04T21:31:44.947Z","text":"easy A , very chill teacher , half of the stuff she says is in Korean , the beginning of K1 is hard and from my experience ( the students block 7 K1 were boring asf)","rating":4,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-04T20:48:25.758Z","text":"She a good teacher not that much  homework and unlimited retakes on test \n","rating":5,"version":0}],"rating":4.75}},"__N_SSG":true}
