He doesn't teach the material in the best way (mostly taking Cornell notes on your own) and going by the textbook. He doesn't lecture/deepen your understanding much. The class is pretty boring especially if you don't really like history. You can talk to him and he'll try to be understanding though. ","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-05T16:42:42.015Z","text":"Probably said a total of 100 words to us the whole school year. Teaches straight from the textbook and never lectures or asks if we understand. Doesn't really have a personality. You can talk in class and go on your phone but you learn nothing and the class is hard. He has so little assignments that it's really difficult to get your grade up. I don't recommend.","rating":2,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-02T22:35:01.355Z","text":"He's fine. He's really chill. Let's you talk in class and go on your phone. If you don't like cornell notes, don't take him. That's all you do. He teaches straight from the textbook.

Lets you correct up to ~80 on all assessments, but not that knowledgeable about US history, teaches straight from the textbook.","rating":3,"version":0}],"rating":2.8333333333333335}},"__N_SSG":true}
