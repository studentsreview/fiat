She also has a really cute dog.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-01T22:00:08.530Z","text":"One of the smartest teacher ever! Even though there’s a lot of workload on a daily basis she makes it very manageable and interesting! The tests are pretty simple; one multiple choice and one short response. Overall, taking her class will not make you feel bored at all and it’s basically very interesting and interactive!!!!","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"she’s an amazing teacher and is very knowledgeable. She teaches with worksheets which isn’t actually as bad as it sounds. she lectures along with the worksheets. Pay attention in class and do good work and you can easily get a low A. One of the best teachers and contributes to why lowell is as good as it’s reputationSubmitted by a student","rating":4.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"she was one of the best teachers I ever had. she gives out a lot of study resources like pre-tests and kahoots so as long as you study off of those the tests will be pretty easy. her grading system can be pretty confusing because she grades out of fours. her sticks also give me MAJOR anxiety because if you don't know the answer then she keeps on pushing you and makes you sound dumb. but overall, she is a great teacher :)Submitted by a student","rating":4.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I honestly found history classes boring until I had Ms. Klein. You usually do worksheets in class but when she does lecture, it's short and super easy to understand. Her tests are multiple choices and short answers; they should be easy if you pay attention to class and review with the pre-test. You do have to do some big projects but they should be enjoyable since you pick the topics. She has a google doc with all the class resources to help you catch up. Super helpful. 10/10 would recommend.Submitted by a student","rating":4.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"ms klein is extremely smart and she knows a lot about what she’s teaching. her class is far from self taught bc she goes over anything you have questions on. tests are multiple choice with geography and have one essay question that’s usually easy. projects pretty easy and are mostly graded on effort. would definitely recommend taking her classSubmitted by a student","rating":4.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Me Klein is such a good teacher. Her course is mainly a ton of worksheets and lecture (guided) notes, but she delivers the material really well and is a really nice person. She can be pretty condescending at times when she calls on you for a question and you don’t know the answer, but other than that I recommend!Submitted by a student","rating":4.9,"version":1}],"rating":4.937499999999999}},"__N_SSG":true}
