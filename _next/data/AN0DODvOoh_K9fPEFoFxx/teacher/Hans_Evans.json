Geo/Alg 2 was easy. He really cares for his students. Pay attention and you will do well.

Your grade in his class is based almost solely on the tests b/c hes too lazy to collect the homework.

He really knows his stuff. He grades homework at least once a week, his tests can be hard but he tells you what's on it ahead on time.

He has a very don't-give-a-crap sense of humor, and though some students find it rude, I think it's hilarious; he's a lot like Harrison Ford lol. It's also very clear that he actually does enjoy math; he tells us math problems that he works on at home and encourages us to check them out as well. He's always open to questions and helping students afterschool. His tests can be tricky but he always goes over what's on them. :)Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Evans is a wonderful geometry teacher.

He makes the tests really really easy and simple- down to the basics. He actually makes the test to see if you really know your stuff or not.
