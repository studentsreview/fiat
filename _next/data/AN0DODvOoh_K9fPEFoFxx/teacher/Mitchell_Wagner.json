Also late to class a lot  and doesn't put in grades until the very last minute. Likes the quiet kids that don't know how to play the piano or the kids that can't stand up for theirselves. He also doesn't teach the material that is on the final.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He teaches a bunch of different bands. and jazz band is the bomb.I play drums and since i had never read charts, i learned a lot after the first semester. He does single people out in class but his intentions are good. easy A for jazz band. The performances are fun and he helped the players bond and have new friends.

He's a good conductor, but a hard grader and definitely plays favorites. I had him for band last year, and for a VPA his class is pretty stressful...I'm now in choir with Mr.Chan and I would recommend that instead. However, if you're good at whatever instrument you play and practice hard, Mr.Wagner will probably like you...so I guess it depends.Submitted by a student","rating":3.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He has a short temper and has trouble giving constructive feedback. However, depending on how proficient you are in your instrument, you may improve a lot by taking his class. He is not a good band director by a long shot and can be disorganized. Jazz band, however, self-manages, and sounds amazing because of the people in it.Submitted by a student","rating":3.8,"version":1}],"rating":3.2399999999999998}},"__N_SSG":true}
