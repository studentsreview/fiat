He is so helpful and so sweet and will go out of his way to explain things to you if you are confused (which is a lot because the class is very hard). He really wants his students to do the best they can and was so encouraging right before we took the AP test. His class is so much fun and he is such an entertaining lecturer.

He's really hard on his students, but that's only because he wants us to do well on the AP test.There are quizzes every Friday on about 1 1/2 chapters of material, and EC outlines (worth 2 points) are due on quiz days. Do the outlines - it really helps! His lectures are awesome, though the occasional class discussions can get intimidating b/c he expects a lot! He knows exactly what he's doing and has everything planned well in advance. He's awesome!

He is a pretty easy A","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"GREAT teacher for students who don't like history! He covers the interesting parts of history that we don't see in textbooks. The tradeoff is that he doesn't spend much time talking about the important stuff. And when he does, he goes into too much depth (far more details than the AP test requires). Unfortunately, he requires us to know those details for his weekly quizzes! You need to study a lot of useless details for the quizzes. Many Q's are based off a SINGLE sentence in lecture or book.","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"HARD class if us history is not your thing. but COOL teacher. really nice,only got mad at us once in the whole semester.","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i LOVE his class...he makes history intresting and fun, and also funny.

Class is always interesting and fun. Very knowledgeable too. His tests can be rather challenging, but certainly possible to do well. It pays off though-you'll be super prepared on the ap exam. He likes to see his students do well.

On a good day, he'll be nice and encouraging. However, on a bad day (majority), he'll be very disrespectful, insensitive, and downright rude. That's his personality and I felt it took away from his ability to teach. His expectations are quite reasonable, but his demeanor reflects poorly on his ability to consistently help guide students to intellectual growth.","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Schwarz is the most amazing teacher ever! He makes being in his class so fun and his lectures are super interesting and funny.

He is a great lecturer, you will learn a lot if you pay attention to his lectures.

Very helpful.","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"His GoPo class takes work to keep up with.

He tries to learn everyone's name, which is a good sign. But I agree that he's moody a lot of the time, and he's often absent.
