I hope you're artistic. :/","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"really nice =) only bad thing is when she says she will only speak to us for 5 mins then winds up talking for the whole class","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"had her for ceramics and she is very nice and a good ceramic's teacher. Just dont cut her class because attendence is a big part of your grade.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's really nice but wastes too much time on name games and stuff. I learned a lot about making cups and stuff.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"hate her class she pisses me off like w/ her stupid comments... dont take her if u plan for only fulfilling the art requirement shell hate u for that","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She gives you an automatic A, unless you don't show upor you screw around. Yeah, she talks a lot, but sometimes she's funny, and she's really nice too. She compliments you on your piece and tells you how good it is, even if it's sort of crappy.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Wonderful teacher. Has loose instruction which leaves you to do what you want w/o being forced into doing something you don't want to do or don't like. Take her unless you don't know what you want to do and would like to have stricter guidelines like Jansen. Helpful but takes some time to get her attention.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"The earlier review I wrote earlier I did not mean, she is actually not that bad of a teacher. In all honesty, she is a pretty chill teacher, but sometimes she is very stressed out. I don't do much in her class and should be an easy A. Do not take her 8th block if you have things to do after school though, because she will keep you to clean up. The class is actually really fun if you have friends there to talk to, but photography or choir would probably be easier and less stressful. But take her.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"shes awesome, easy A, boring class","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Very annoying. never clear on directions and cant make up her mind.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ceramics Advanced. No deadlines, little instructions, Laid back. It's very independent. If you need help, she'll give it to you, but you'll have to wait practically the whole class time until she's free to help you. By that time, your next class will be starting. So ask for help quickly","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms Rode is a really good teacher.

She's so passionate in what we do and is always there to support her students! Plus, she makes ceramics funnnnnn! Just the greatest. Take her if you can, for sure :)","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Her class is pretty chill. Dont take her Block 8. She seems to get more raged at block 8 because sometimes earlier blocks dont clean up and assumes block 8 did it. She will threaten the class with a B, but please just do what she tells you. Theres no point arguing back. Shes already under a lot of stress especially near the end of the semester. Just do your work and dont do nothing. Try to be productive. She will give u an A if she alwasy see u working o nsomething","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Rode is really nice; she wants to see her students succeed, but she's not that great of a design teacher.
