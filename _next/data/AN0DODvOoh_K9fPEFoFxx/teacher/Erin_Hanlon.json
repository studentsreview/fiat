She really cares about her students and tries her best not to stress us out too much. We have home work most nights from the textbook but its not too hard. You also don't have to bring your textbook to class which is a huge plus!! Her class is mostly lecturing and worksheets which she tries her best to keep interesting. Lots of group work. Her multiple choice tests are usually very easy.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1}],"rating":4.4}},"__N_SSG":true}
