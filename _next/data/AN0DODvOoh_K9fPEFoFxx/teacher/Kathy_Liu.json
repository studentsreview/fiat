Her classes are usually boring, because most of the time she just gives you a quick ten minute review of what you went over yesterday and then you work silently with your group for the rest of the class on textbook problems. Her style of teaching is usually just pulling up a slideshow and having you write down notes. The tests are moderate as long as you payed attention to the problems that you did in class. If the whole class does bad, then she curves the test scores really high. It is really hard to get less than a B on the tests unless you did not pay any attention. Overall, Ms. Liu can be funny but you do not learn that much unless you study yourself.","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Thanks for being a great teacher.

She makes math a lot clearer and my math skills actually improved a lot. She always encourages us to use multiple approaches to solve problems.

I had her for geo. Does not do a lot of actual teaching, she kind of teaches about a concept and then we do problems from the textbook and go over them. It's kind of hard to understand her sometimes because of her accent, and when you ask a question she doesn't give a clear answer. But overall her class is pretty easy. Not too much hw and the tests aren't that bad if you know what you're doing in class.Submitted by a student","rating":3.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Really did not enjoy her class. She's terrible at teaching the material and often doesn't give partial credit on tests. She also very rarely curves.

You don't learn much, and if you really want to know the material you have to study on your own. She sometimes curves tests or gives extra credit points if the class does badly on a test.

I guess I like her as a person but she is so bad at teaching. I mean she tries but it's totally self-learn. She's really entertaining in class when she's not trying to be but sometimes can get annoying. 15-20 min HW almost every night, tests are an easy B if you just look through the material. She can sometimes be unreasonable especially with construction but if you have a horrible pick and get her it's really not that bad.Submitted by a student","rating":3.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Liu really cares about her students' learning.

Although she might not be clear at times, she's such a genuine person and teacher that will be willing to help if you don't understand. I also love her sense of humor cause she's pretty weird but that's what makes her class more memorable. Even though my first impression of her wasn't the best, I have come to realize during the semester how much she loves being a teacher and how much she loves her class.
