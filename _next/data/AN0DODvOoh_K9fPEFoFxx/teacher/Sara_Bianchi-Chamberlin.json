Just take a picture of your homework, that usually takes five minutes at most, and attach it to the assignment. She doesn't check for correctness and doesn't give homework on test weeks to give you time to study. We did many fun projects like a Dia de los Muertos ofrenda and a cooking project. We watched a TV show called Eres Tu Maria? and it was engaging and fun to watch.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Knows a ton.
