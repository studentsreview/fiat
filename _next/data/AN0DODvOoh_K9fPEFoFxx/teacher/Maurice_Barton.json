He made us do a lot of book work and pushes you alot. He helped me improve. The only thing is hes very strict in archery and his passive aggressiveness madd me cry but he did give me a pat on the back do im fine now. Overall 5/5 would recommend ","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-05T02:01:48.982Z","text":"Super nice teacher, but he does play favorites. He never gives too much work, and half the time when we're in the classroom we just watch a movie.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-04T19:48:42.050Z","text":"Pushes you to do well in his class. Has favorites, especially those who will joke around with him. Girl's locks got cut off because he didn't read locker instructions. Easy A if you put in effort though.","rating":2,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-03T00:39:06.836Z","text":"He's an okay PE teacher.
