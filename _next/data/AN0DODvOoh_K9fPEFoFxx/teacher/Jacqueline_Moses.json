If I actually put effort into her quizzes, I could’ve gotten an A, but I didn’t so I got a B in her class.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-03T00:53:13.173Z","text":"She is a very nice teacher, very positive and supportive. I took her for English 2B, and she was really chill. I don't know if her policy changed (since I took her fall '19), but she required a lot for participation. I wouldn't say she's an \"easy A\" class, but it is not impossible.","rating":4,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Even though she's quite hard, she's really funny and awesome to have for English. She does vocabulary tests every 1-2 weeks or so and THAT is what affected my grade a lot. It's easy if you fully know the definition and memorize ALL the synonyms and antonyms she gives within the definition. She grade essays very harshly; She will help you on your essay face-to-face though. She let's you re-do your essay if its a C+ or below- she'll help you with that and probably will bring it a grade up or 2.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Definitely take her if you want to expand your writing skills and reading comprehension, but know that she she grades tests and essays very harshly. She's a fantastic teacher, but if you're looking for a class in which you don't have to put much effort, choose someone else. In this class, you really need to give your all in order to receive a good grade. Also, word of advice to anyone taking her during 1st; show up on time every day. Overall, Ms. Moses is a great instructor, albeit challenging.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She helps her students one on one when you need help writing an essay.

You talk for virtually the whole class and may review vocab or story's for the rest. Where her class turns into hell is the tests. The tests are super hard if you don't study and I don't know anyone who got above a 95 on the final. I'd recommend her to anyone who want the most chill time but you need to be ready to put in the work when you need to.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1}],"rating":4.2749999999999995}},"__N_SSG":true}
