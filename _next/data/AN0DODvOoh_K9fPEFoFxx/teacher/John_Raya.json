Basically his whole AP Spanish class is discussing things in Spanish and learning new vocab, plus we do some practice AP tests. I’ve been speaking Spanish for a while and feel prepared for the AP test, but I’ve heard from others who are newer to the language that his class didn’t prepare them. However, the class itself is not hard, and he is a really nice guy.

You might as well just forget everything that you know because he rarely tests you on past knowledge. He often goes over the same material several times and has mood swings in class. He can be funny and the whole class had a good time, but he never teaches. The homework that he assigns is never checked and he gives you a full grade if it looks like you wrote something on the paper. You can get away with not doing any of the work and still get an easy A. The tests are usually just vocabulary and as long as you are good at memorizing words you will never have to put any effort into the class.","rating":2,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"good teacher.........................................................................................","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"coolest teacher EVER!! if you want an easy A take him...","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Monsier Raya est tres bon, tres bien, et tres excellent!Submitted by a student","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"AWESOMMEEE!! he is sooo cool. just study your french and you'll be fine!","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Raya is very disorganized and cluttered. Every class he takes the first 15-20 minutes to shuffle around his desk, and try to attempt to get his stuff together. I haven't learned much french from him. He is very was and almost always offers re-takes on tests. He goes off topic a lot about his experiences that don't relate to what we are learning. Most of the time we just watch movies(in english) or have cultural parties where we eat nutella.","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Raya is incredibly disorganized and irresponsible. He sometime fails to complete the most basic of tasks (such as not posting homework because he \"doesn't have time\") and he never admits fault for anything, blaming everything from his TAs to the fact that he hasn't had his second cup of coffee. The difficulty of his exams (and sometimes even the class itself) is extremely arbitrary and depends on what mood he's in.

If you get him 16-17, he sometimes lets you out early. It's not very hard to get an A unless you don't study at all. Not much homework.

Mr. Raya is one of the worst teachers ever. He's so unorganized and barely teaches us anything. He is extremely moody and takes it out on his students. He has 7 TA's in one period which makes no sense. He always tests us on material he hasn't gone over with us in class. He always makes his test last minute. A few days before a test he will tell you he hasn't finished making yet and cant guarantee what will be on it.ughSubmitted by a student","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"J.RAYA IS THA BOMB!IL EST LA BOMBE!","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"had him for french. really easy but you don't learn a lot. he's nice and funny. our final was to do a report on a french food and make it. extremely easy A.","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Very Hard! and mean too! yelled at my friend and that is totally not cool!","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"HE'S THE COOLEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!! it's an easy A just as long as u study for the tests","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I'd probably be learning more in another french class, but Raya's alright, and not having another class to worry about is a big plus.
