She grades the essays like an English class. I got docked 8 points because i needed to write it into separate paragraphs when she said to make one paragraph.

Almost all of the multiple choice questions and frqs on the exam were questions we've had on in class tests. Coincidence? I think not.

You outline 5 pgs a night - but people just tend to wait till the last minute to do it. Her worksheets are kinda useless. APUSH is not a hard class if you have her. You might not retain all the information but you definitely won't hate it. She does prepare you for the AP if you outline the book. Some people just blindly outline it without reading and that's bad for any AP classes. Bellville is a choice. I got an A without doing much.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"bellville loves the \"big picture\" of things. this was the downfall for me in APUSH. i felt lost, i didn't retain a lot of information either because there are no lectures. the powerpoints won't prep you well either. the handouts are mildly helpful though. and her outlines are mandatory also...which is good that it forces you to do them, but they were a pain at times. overall, i didn't find her to be as good an APUSH teacher as i did with her in modern world.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's an awesome teacher for APUS. There's homework every night, so don't fall behind on your outlines; lecture the next day will also be VERY boring if you have no idea what she's talking about. Keep your grades up throughout the year though... so it can even out with the final just in case you do badly. And yeah... I found the final really hard (tricky questions, etc). =/ I haven't had her for Modern World, but of what I've seen, she's several times easier.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"... she is legit, I learned more in her class than any other I ever have","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I LOVE HER!

On a personal level she bothered me she had some weird thing with me and only me where she thought there was something wrong. It felt like she was trying to pry into my personal life. She would call home even if I did nothing wrong, send me to the wellness, or my counselor.

Around 5 hrs of reading hw per week plus maybe 1 hour for the out of the blue hw assignments and study guide. She has a 3 wk sheet telling u what is going to happen.

U will get roasted though - make sure u don't take her too seriously when she insults uOtherwise interesting and fun class (freshman u get to do projects mostly instead of essays so be prepared to make posters and/or powerpoints)Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"take her for APUSH. she's sarcastic, silly, and *seems* hard at first, but it's pretty easy to get an A and you're waaay more prepared for the AP test than other teachers. Schwarz and schmidt are ok if you want to deal with a lot of work and zero support. Bellville will show you exactly how to write good DBQs and FRQs. You're slowly pushed harder, and by second semester you're confident faced with any prompt. She's also just so sweet, helpful, and genuinely cares about her students.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i DESPISE ms. bellville as a person. she is VERY prententious. as a teacher, she isn't bad, pretty easy.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's a wonderful teacher. You learn in her class and you have fun. Her tests are a bit hard, get the handbook she recommends it helps. Listen to lectures and the videos she shows are great. No final after AP Test. There is occassional extra credit. Easily person to talk to and very down to earth.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms Bellville is fun. She can teach and can be funny and nice all at the same time. But since she teaches history, class can get boring sumtimes. Yoga = fun, though. ^_^","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Great as a person. Bad as a teacher. Had her for APUSH. Wasn't very helpful. All I remember doing is sleeping in her class while she read off information on the print outs. Either that, or she'd have powerpoints up, which also didn't help. Her outlines are a pain too: must be hand-written. My hand always ends up hurting after an outline.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She is not easy and plays favorites. Her lesson consists of Power points that dont explain any thing and her tests are pointless. She doesnt even lecture or attempt to explain history. she also is slow on returning work. There are much better teachers out there including Shure (She actually teaches this year and is better than last), schmidt, swartz and wold. `","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Always very rude, expects you to learn from powerpoints.

Her class is fairly easy if you pay attention. She doesn't force you to take notes, but I'd recommend doing so. There are a lot of projects though. This year we did two in-class essays, three presentations and lots of group work. She has a weird sense of humor but she's pretty funny nonetheless. She's very nice as well. Make sure to always be on time with your assignments because she won't accept late work.Submitted by a student","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"As said before, she's really nice and for modern world, we did yoga every friday!
