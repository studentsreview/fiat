Best math teacher at Lowell. He encourages people to speak up and praises them for not being afraid to ask for help. He assigns a reasonable amount of homework and checks randomly 2-3 times a week. Tests and quizzes are on things covered by homework, and he goes over all homework problems that people need help with. Sarcastic at times, but overall a really cool guy, actually made Pre-Calc fun.do homework ask for help if needed = learn a lot A in the classBAM.math","rating":4.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I have Zeeman for advanced algebra.
