Super understanding and nice. Barely any homework is given and  is an easy A. Just do the few assignments he gives you and pay attention and youâ€™ll be fine.

The class consists of Hazlo Ahora, reviewing hw, and usually going through a google slides presentation with different activities to do. His class isn't hard as long as you finish the assigned work (hw, Hazlo Ahoras, projects, etc). Tests are pretty long but not unbearable. Make sure to pay attention in class.
