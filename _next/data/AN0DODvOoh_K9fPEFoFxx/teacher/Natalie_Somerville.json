She is the most creative, understanding, generous teachers I've ever had. she is hard sometimes and pushes us to do things outside of our comfort zones, yes. but she guides us when we reach out and try. she looks for improvement, thoughtfulness, and attempt. she has amazing stories about the world and gives us time and guidance when we reach out. introduces us to new ways of thinking and interpreting. made me love English for the first time.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Assigns lots of homework one day and expects it back the next. Doesn't spread out homework well. However, she is really knowledgeable and I thought our mini unit on resumes was really insightful.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Having English with Ms. Somerville was the first time I felt like my creativity had been sparked in the classroom. I wonder if these reviews are even about the same teacher. She's open minded, caring, funny, and supportive. Make a student cry? If s/he can't handle humor. She tried different ways to make class interesting and she even started each class with meditation. Don't let these negative complaint reviews scare you. She's amazing and has the kindest heart. She left to volunteer in Nepal!Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1}],"rating":4.2}},"__N_SSG":true}
