on and on and repeats the same things. Pull out your phone, and you will never hear the end of it. talk about doing something that's against the rules, and you'll be subjected to a 10 minute long speech about the importance of being a lowell student, how you're so priveliged to be here, and how everyone works so hard to give you the best education in the state and you just through it all away by breaking the rules.","rating":1,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"sometimes rude but could really teach","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had Ms. Reller for computer programming, and she dosen't seem to know much about the subject...Whenever I ask her a simple question, she wouldn't know how to answer and says alot of other things to change the subject. In addition she was surprised that the rect function in javascript had a fifth parameter. Not to mention she did not know the CTRL+Z command for undo, which I presume programmers should know...nothing against her personally. But a teacher knowledgeable in the subject is nice.","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Had her for both programming and science and I would recommend her for computer science but not programming. Comp sci with Reller was my favourite class at Lowell, but programming was boring and I disapprove of her heavy reliance on Khanacademy. Ms Reller is helpful and nice but can be a bit confusing at times.Submitted by a student","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Reller's a great teacher, one of the few that an actually teach and explain concepts. Her tests are pretty straight forward. Everything depends on her mood, which a lot of times suck.

Pretty fun class, take with friends.","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Reller isn't very knowledgeable. She doesn't know what she's talking about most of the time. She follows Khan Academy videos and her lessons are based off Mr. Simon. Reller probably doesn't even know the difference between computer SCIENCE and computer PROGRAMMING. You're better off self teaching yourself or taking Mr. Simon if he's still around.Submitted by a student","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She is very nice, in fact, too nice of a teacher. If you are answer incorrectly in front of the class, she'll try to make it seem like its not your fault. She is so nice, I get tired of it, just tell the student that they are wrong cause it was their fault! Otherwise, the kid would never learn. She seems unexperienced cause her teaching isn't that great. She contradicts herself, and she more than often gets a problem wrong and blames it on something else, (like she isn't awake, etc.)","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had her for computer programming in Spring 2014 and looking back, I really hated this class because of how hostile and unapproachable she is. I thought this class was going to be helpful for me to get some experience for CS at Cal this year but I really feel like I hate computer science by this experience. No, I do not find CP hard but I think I'm going to do programming as a hobby than as a major by learning by myself, which I should had done back in my senior year. Easy teacher though!","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's really nice and gives you points even though you did bad. If you tried to learn, she's happy with it. Sometimes she can be boring and give you problems over and over again and not let you start homework even though you understand the concept already. She's too much a goody-two-shoes as well. For example, she has to let you out at EXACTLY the time the mod ends. A tip, never go to her when you need to get a stamp to complete your schedule.","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"If you want an easy A and don't really care about CS, then she will be the easiest teacher. If you're taking this class to learn, just don't. She doesn't teach. Her lesson plan relies on Khan academy. I have asked for help on multiple occasions, but most of the time she doesn't help you. Instead, she just tells you to look through your code.Submitted by a student","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Reller is great. She explains everything clearly & she isn't boring, she will be mean to you if you do something stupid or something that would annoy her, but she's usually cheery & nice. She also offers help afteschool & during free mods.","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Reller is passive aggressive and bases most of her assignments off stuff like code.org or khan academy. She does seem passionate about computer science and programming, but doesn't really teach well. She's a very confusing teacher who doesn't curve on quizzes (We took a quiz where the average was super low but all she had to say was \"there is definitely room for improvement\") and will even put quiz questions with no correct answer on accident.Submitted by a student","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Laid back. Very sarcastic. Likes people who improve. Good with the whole geometry stuff. Collects homework periodically. Tests are usually given weekly to help raise that grade you may need. Very nice too. =]","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"unlike what others may say about her I think she is a very good teacher.

I highly recomend her 4 algebra.","rating":2.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"GRAGH....she's really moody all the time...I had her for precal and she just doesnt know how to give points.

I don't understand why students say she is unapproachable. Took her for geo during my freshman year.. I was just reading the math book most of the time and it's simple logic.

She's the best Algerbra teacher I've had so far, and I've had 3, long story.

She relies heavily on Khanacademy to teach computer programming instead of properly teaching us.
