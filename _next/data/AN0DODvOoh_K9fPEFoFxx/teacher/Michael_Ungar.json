I too him this semester and the class was pretty easy, the exams are kind of hard but he teaches from his lectures and sometimes the text books. notes are assigned but not checked, for your own benefit. most of the grades come from test and he also does a lot of presentations and debates. he lectures almost everyday so it's hard for some people to stay awake but if you're ever lost he makes sure to clarify. although you might fall asleep, a good teacher all around.Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1}],"rating":4.3}},"__N_SSG":true}
