You don't have to read the textbook but his research projects are no joke. OMG they're so time consuming! DO NOT PROCRASTINATE in his class if you take him. Tuason also gets really angry sometimes and doesn't like people who come late to class. Not the easiest teacher, but you'll learn a lot in the lectures and projects. Avoid him if you want an easy A or don't want to do work.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Tuason may be quite difficult with his exams, but he gives out a ton of extra-credit.

After the first month of adjusting to Lowell, Mr. Tuason really picked it up. He showed interesting videos that connected with what we learned and gave projects. The presidential campaign project was my favorite! He had us create campaign posters, plan a fundraiser, and make tv commericals to either promote our candidate or do some mudslinging against an opponent. I loved how his projects let us use what we learned in such a creative outlet! Take him!","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Tuason is hard but it's all worth it for his sass. :)Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"A very intimidating serious guy. Deep in the inside he's funny but his class is honestly challenging. Chill lectures but a fair amount of daily reading for homework and daily quizzes in modern world. His class is a great prep for AP World! If you have a chance, take him, he really prepares you for time management! Not an easy A but with all those extra credit, I brought up my C to an A within a grading period. A very awesome intellectual person!!!Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1}],"rating":4.504761904761906}},"__N_SSG":true}
