He gives a test every Monday and Friday but they're always curved so you don't really have to worry about them, plus they make good review material to better prepare you.

He is the most understanding teacher that I have ever had. To be honest, history has been my worst subject up until I took him. He might go over the material a little fast, but he will always have a recap of his lectures and is open to any questions you have. You even get to negotiate with him if you feel that a question on the test was unfair.

Please do not take him for granted. If, and only if, you take him and his class seriously, you learn A LOT. If he finds himself lacking knowledge on a particular subject, he'll come back to you after researching on it. He researches like crazy on how to teach the class well. Organized, he has a lecture outline which makes it easy to follow along.

He gives two quizzes a week, but the credit scale is so generous that they're not hard, i.e. 8/10 on a quiz goes on Schoolloop as 100%. He also lets you argue any questions that you feel are unfair.
