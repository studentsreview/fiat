While he may seem odd, he actually can be pretty funny sometimes. This class focuses a lot on studying by yourself, and you can turn in the homework whenever you want. The tests are all word problems, but if you paid attention to the homework you should get at least a B. He is usually always available for help and you can spend multiple blocks taking the unit tests if you need to. He tends to go off on a lot of tangents, but overall the class is fun as long as you put some effort in.","rating":4,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-01-30T03:49:56.735Z","text":"Quirky guy but you he does a good job of teaching you physics.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2019-06-04T21:45:23.786Z","text":"Class can be boring but he is always there to help you after class.

Assignments outside of class are always due on Fridays and it is never posted later than the Saturday before, so you are more than free enough to ponder the concepts at your own pace. Do recommend studying topics early. Know some key vocab, and you won't lose momentum during Monday lectures.Interesting humor. PC? Nope.Submitted by a student","rating":3.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"(AP Physics 1) Mr. Dickerman's class can be very useful if you can self-study. Although the homework isn't due until the end of the semester, make sure you do it each week so you're ready for the quiz and the eventual test. I don't think he teaches well at all, and personally had to self-study nearly every concept. The best thing about his class (other than the end of semester turn in hw) is that he gives you TONS of previous year FRQ's and multiple choices to help study for the AP testSubmitted by a student","rating":3.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"An all around great teacher, took him for AP Physics 1, you can do pretty much anything in his class and he dosen't care, layed back but he will go out of his way to help you, 10/10 would take again.Submitted by a student","rating":3.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"just bad and so hard. the tests are almost all word problems, which are hard for most students.Submitted by a student","rating":3.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. dickerman is awesome! i've had him for two years and his class is by far one of the chillest classes ever. you can pretty much do whatever in his class, and he won't really call you out on it, as long as you do well. if you pay attention to his lectures, you can get an A no problem because he teaches great :) also, he does tend to go off on sideline stories about politics and geology and whatnot, but nonetheless they're funny and interesting.overall, he's a really great teacherSubmitted by a student","rating":3.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Dickerman is awesome. He's always willing to help a student out, whether you're just trying to learn the basics of the material or really pushing the bounds of your learning and the scope of the class. Nice to all the students and will go out of his way to answer any questions.
