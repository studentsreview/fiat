His class is pretty chill. What can you really expect from P.E. though? As long as you're on time, in your uniform, have your sportsfolio when you're in room 21, and at least look like you're trying, you'll get an A EASILY.

His class does really fun sports and that makes pe pass by really fast. He may be pretty tough compared to Axt or Donohue, but compared to other pe teachers, he's pretty chill.

We didn't do any book work this semester. He is a nutter for attendance. Just look like you're trying and show up on time. He has a temper. If you start off being a really good student then slowly slack off, he will give you a B. He usually doesn't give B's.... So set low expectations. And he expects for from the guys than the girls.

Definitely favors the athletic people, or the people in sports. We is quite a stickler on attendance, so try not to be late. However, sometimes when he's in his \"bad mood\", uh.... watch out.
