Although he likes to make fun of his students sometimes, he is actually very caring and a good P.E. teacher.

Even though he projects this kinda harsh persona, it's all a joke and he is actually super nice to his students.

Easy A. Running is a breeze--no one in my class has issues. I didn't like football, but his class made me able to at least throw and catch the football, and enjoy games with my classmates. He actually teaches you proper technique, and is physically able to do everything he teaches us. Starts the semester with \"PE Journals\" where you log sleep, quality of sleep, food, and drink daily, but eventually stops after a while, according to some former students.

He's super funny and cares about all his students. He makes class fun, and you actually do activities. Although he makes you do a food log, I didn't fill out any of it and it didn't matter because he didn't check. He doesn't care if you don't wear your full PE uniform either. He usually does have run days but they're not timed and he doesnt care if you walk him.

He actually makes you exercise and will yell at you (in a joking way) if you slack off. He actually cares about making his students fit, and doesn't pay attention to sportsfolios as much.
