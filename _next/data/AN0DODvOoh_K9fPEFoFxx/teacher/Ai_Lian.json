Ms. Lian lectures in this very enthusiastic voice and make her class fun with random activities and puns.  She does go pretty fast, even for a regular chemistry class and I would say she prepared me very well for AP Chemistry with Mr. Fong. Some people think her class is hard, and it is, but as long as you do the work, pay attention in class, and ask questions, it should be pretty easy to get a low A. Would 100% reccommend :)","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Overall, Ms. Lian is a pretty good chemistry teacher. If you ever need help, she'd be willing to work with you after school to make sure you know what you're doing. Her test are kinda hard. Sometimes she can be a little confusing and moves kinda fast but she'll explain things for you if you ask question. She barely uses the textbook and there is a lot of note taking from her power points. Overall, I would recommend Ms. Lian for chem.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Lian can look intimidating sometimes but if you show her respect and be a good student overall then she'll like you a lot! Even though chemistry is a tough subject, Ms. Lian still manage to make the class fun and engaging so you won't dread going to her class. Lastly, her tests are not the easiest so study study study!Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"My grades are A's and the occasional B, but I'm getting a B in Lian. I read all the reviews on rate my teacher and decided to take Ms. Lian's class. I was entirely unprepared for the amount of work we do and the difficulty of her tests. Fist off, you will receive a weekly Tuesday quiz (most of which are fairly hard), and although she teaches the content her tests still are super, super hard. It's as if she takes what she teaches and then doubles the difficulty. I really wish I was not in Lian..Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms.Lian is very friendly and enthusiastic. If you have any questions, she'll be glad to help. She likes to make chemistry fun and tries to get everyone to participate. If you do the work, study, and pay attention in class, you should be fine. There are make-up tests if you bomb the test really badly and there isn't a lot of homework either (mainly worksheets, sometimes questions in the textbook). The labs are pretty fun too.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Lian is a fantastic chemistry teacher. She teaches you everything you need to know and is very clear about it, as well as about her expectations for what you need to know on the tests. Definitely recommend her.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Although Ms. Lian is highly knowledgeable with the material she is teaching, she is VERY harsh with her grading and assignments. Don't let that friendly face fool you. This teacher WILL NOT round your 89.9 to a 90. If you do have her, I recommend getting on her good side and studying for at least one hour beforehand for her exams. Also, she doesn't use the textbook whatsoever so if you like self-studying, good luck with that.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Lian is just a really great chem teacher. She explains the concept, we copy notes, and then we have a ton of practice opportunities so the material really gets drilled into you. As long as you study and know/understand the material, her tests and quizzes aren't too hard. She does get picky when grading labs but her teaching style really works and I have learned and remember a lot from her class. Take her!!Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I would definitely recommend Ms. Lian to any student. She is SUPER nice and cares about all of her students, but will reprimand someone if they are not following directions. She teachers really well and has you take notes that she gives on the projector and goes through lots of examples of the topic to make sure everybody understands what they are doing. You won't be bored in class as she always have everyone working on the subject, but with that said, the class is NOT super hard. TAKE MS. LIAN!Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Lian is a great teacher! She genuinely cares about her students and we do lots of fun labs. This year we did tie-dye and made smores in class. Her tests can be kind of hard, but she gives you lots of practice to make sure you are prepared. She doesn't curve her exams but gives exam retakes and has a few extra credit opportunitites. She makes her lectures fun and helps us remember concepts with bad chemistry jokes. She even put a meme in her powerpoint. By far my favorite teacher at Lowell!!!Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1}],"rating":4.459999999999999}},"__N_SSG":true}
