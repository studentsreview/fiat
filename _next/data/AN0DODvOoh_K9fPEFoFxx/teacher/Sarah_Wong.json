I am a freshman who is struggling in her class ! I would not recommend taking her. Often she is very lazy to grade and do things. She makes things up as we go and it is very unorganized. ( ex. we turned in our hw in beginning of class* then she goes “also did you guys translate this or that” and she never said anything to us about it and we all end up with a bad grade ) Her TA’s are also really mean :/ They are as strict as her and they all grade our work however they want. It is very stressful when they grade bc they dont tell u what you get wrong they only put a sad face . TAKE HER CLASS AT YOUR OWN RISK","rating":2,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2019-12-13T04:14:28.115Z","text":"Japan 1 student here :)! From my upperclassmen, I’ve heard thats she’s not AS strict as she was before, and that she’s actually pacing herself now, meaning she’s actually trying to improve! However, her classes might be too slow, as she is trying to explain way too much and maybe too many side comments. + Some of her TAs are just literally so off abt scores (complaint) If they mark stuff you didn’t learn before, check in with Wong sensei! Drawback, always late dismissal like everyone’s said (assure u! very rare to have early or on time). I haven’t had any issues with her work, but it always depends on the student :) ","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She is pretty lazy. She makes you go after school to her class if the activity we were doing takes more time than she thought. Given a couple of papers to her and they just disappear. She will not talk to anybody about stuff like that.Submitted by a student","rating":1.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"she is nice. that's the only good thing. in Japanese 1, she makes you ask questions only in japanese, so if you have a question you can't ask with extremely basic phrases, you might as well shut your mouth. homework is easy but tests are HARD. she also lets you out late every single day. i have history afterwards, which is far away. I run to class but I still always miss the first part of quizzes in history because of her, which actually affects my grade in history. I do not recommend at all!Submitted by a student","rating":1.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Even for just Japanese 1, she speaks pretty much only in Japanese and it is very difficult to understand. I got very confused and stressed due to her class and would not recommend taking it. She is not clear and half the class does not know what’s going on. Would recommend any other classes over hers. She lets people out late which has caused problems for me.Submitted by a student","rating":1.8,"version":1}],"rating":2.0500000000000003}},"__N_SSG":true}
