really sweet and interactive. Her class is really easy though and she gives a lot of extra credit/test corrections. So even if you end up with a lot of C's on your weekly quizes, you can still end up with a pretty high grade in the class. The only thing I didn't really like about her class was her lectures. She basically has power points with long paragraphs that she reads off of and honestly, it's the same a reading the textbook.
