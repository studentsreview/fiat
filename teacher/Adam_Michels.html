I got a 5 on the AP Psych test too.Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"GREAT","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"As an AP Psychology teacher, he's a really good teacher. His tests are really easy and the only homework he assigns are textbook notes. If you read fast, you can finish tests in around 15-20 minutes. He grades really leniently for FRQs. It's hard to not get an A. He also doesn't really teach from a textbook. Instead he incorporates fun clips and educational videos into his lectures to spice the information up. He's super nice and approachable, and I definitely recommend him.Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He isn't much of a teacher, but I like his class very much. It's entertaining and always fun to be in. But his tests can be a little difficult. You do have to study for the tests, and if you don't .. well, your grades are mostly based on tests. But if you do the outlines it's not hard to get a B in the class.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"lol he's hella funny. A easy too","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"cool teacher, optional outlines for extra credit but i suggest doing them so you do well on the test. generally easy. you get to watch a lot of video clips in his class that is a nice break from constant lecturing. the frq and dpq are graded fairly and not too hard. the multiple choice test have a cuvre, about 3-5 percent in generally and about 5 percent more if you do the outline, that is amost a 10 percent curve, a whole grade practically","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Really nice. His quirkiness is very endearing, and he makes the class enjoyable with his teasing humor. His lectures sometimes verge on boring, but then, I feel that way about a lot of history teachers. As everyone has said, an A is achievable.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Best APUSH teacher ever. Laid back, funny, tests are easy if you read CourseNotes and the book. He really points things out that you could see on the AP test. Pay attention to his vids/clippings, very important. Really fun projects. Best part: schedules lectures so class is done on time for AP's. :)","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"his lectures weren't that boring. but your whole grade (almost) is based on tests, which are somtimes hard. for apush at least","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Legit teacher.

I have him for AP Psychology. Its mainly lecturing but he includes interesting videos and clips that will not bore you! He's very funny too, but his tests are difficult if you study last minute. get your outlines done, don't procrastinate. :)","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Well I just got my AP score, and I got a 5! Im sure it wasn't because of my teacher first semester, so it had to be Mr. Michels! He's the nicest guy ever and is somewhat lenient. His lectures are very helpful but not too exciting. His tests are rather hard and you cant use the excuse \"you never taught us that\" because he says its only fair to do that because the AP has questions that youll never see.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"hm.. its like impossible to get an A. tests are very challenging","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Lazy teacher.

He has the perfect clip for every concept in AP Psych., and he keeps up the the most current research in the field. The notes are graded a bit strictly, but it helps you learn the material. One of the best classes at Lowell.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"mr. michels is extremely funny in this really dry and sometimes mean way. it's really odd because he seems like a total homebody, but man he has a wicked sense of humor!! oh and he seems like a perfect husband and dad. haha. back to my point, he is a very good teacher.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Had him for AP Psych this year and it honestly has been the best class I've taken at Lowell. Its the only class I've actually looked forward to going to. The subject itself is interesting and incredibly easy, but Mr. Michels makes it so funny and enjoyable. Funny lectures, barely any work. Hes almost a friend. Going to miss this class so much, take him!!!","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"his class is filled with anecdotes and videos. optional outlines are definitely a plus for the stressed out junior. tests are pretty easy. you will remember things for the AP test, so no worries. i got a 5 (:","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"For econ he's easy, but for US...uhh not really.

A lot of people ended up regretting taking him. He isn't the type of teacher that gives a lot of homework/reinforcement. It's up to you to study for the tests and do the outlines for an extra 5% boost on your test grade. I really liked his class because it was so laid back, and he always made humorous remarks.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Sarcastic. Really nice. I fall asleep in his class all the time though, but he doesn't care.

He teaches using his powerpoints and a bunch of videos. Interesting videos but I don't pay attention during class, just study textbook notes (his only hw) and you'll do fine on the tests. The class is just fun, esp if you have friends in the class. I felt like I did good on the ap test but i was self-motivated to study. 100% would take againSubmitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He is great teacher and very funny, in a subtle way.
