You can ask him for help individually, but the majority of class time is spent doing classwork/homework in table groups. The tests are EXACTLY like the homework. Keep in mind you&#x27;ll only have 3-5 tests per semester (with the addition of homework as &quot;extra credit&quot;) so you have to be very mindful of your grade.

The tests always use questions from the book, but are scored according to his opinion (or something.) Even though HW gives 10% extra grade on a test, he sometimes annulls it because it &quot;doesn&#x27;t show enough effort.&quot; Meaning, you don&#x27;t have to do it right, but to do it &quot;with effort.&quot; I think it&#x27;s just easier to do it right.

The tests always use questions from the book, but are scored according to his opinion (or something.) Even though HW gives 10% extra grade on a test, he sometimes annulls it because it \"doesn't show enough effort.\" Meaning, you don't have to do it right, but to do it \"with effort.\" I think it's just easier to do it right. Sometimes, he gives retake tests, which helped me.","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"hes funny but when it comes to teaching, he's not as clear as i'd like him to be.","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"he is not a good teacher,he doesn't really explain to u.dropping a pencil on the floor would be considered disturbing him.hes not hard and kinda easy.dont take him if u wanna learn","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"frankly, you learn nothing in his class. he spends too much time cracking jokes and talking with the students than teaching. don't take him if you want to learn.","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"he's a great teacher! he always want u to learn..and he gives ppl chances to retake test if whole class fails...","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"this guy is so funny! study for the tests...study those tricky problems in the book he'll get u on those","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Well basically, if you're great in math, he should be really easy.
