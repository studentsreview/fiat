You learn a lot from her class, and she's really helpful and outgoing. She doesn't put anything you dont know on the tests, and if you get a bad grade she'll help you move it up. Im so sad she's not teaching next semester. She always tries to make history fun. by far one of the best teachers at lowell!","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Her College and Career class was awsome. We had little to no homework, the sparce few was a small report researching any job we wanted. Her class is really relaxed, and she adds all of these cool videos and stuff (including a movie clip from Election) to her lessons. She's open to new ideas, and probably will eb even better next time she teaches C and C due to her students requests.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Bower is an excellent Psych teacher. She makes psych concepts as clear as possible by using pictures and great video clips to do so in her powerpoints. She has great energy while teaching and she is very understanding and open to talk if any problems in her class or have a big workload.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Honestly, she's the nicest person ever. She is very encouraging, even though I am pretty bad at PE. She has only ever gotten mad at someone when they literally put someone else in mortal danger (We do some dangerous stuff like archery). She's good at what she teaches, and some how knows and is good at every unit. The only fun unit we missed was tumbling, as she has some back problems and can't do tumbling. I really recommend her. She's so kind and supportive.Submitted by a student","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Bower is very active and a kid at heart.

Since she's young she understands the low interest levels among most students in American Government, so she'll toss in some cartoons, comedy skits, and Daily Show bits that relate to topical issues.
