Even though his class is the hardest class I have grade-wise, I still find enjoyment in it, compared to other classes. Lessons are super fun. He assigns and goes over homework daily, and has tests that require an understanding one level than that of the homework. But he curves test scores based on the class average(s). I found that to maintain a decent grade (solid B) in his class, I have to stay diligent at all times.
