She seems knowledgeable and is an approachable teacher, who is nice and not that difficult (given that you try). She is a rather fast essay grader, \u0026 when reading difficult texts, she tries to explain and help students understand as much of it as possible (Shakespeare plays were hell to me, \u0026 now they are quite manageable).

Classes were mainly group assignments, while the HW was fairly reasonable. Quizzes were kinda annoying, but the final was extremely difficult. The reason: she slacks on her grading of assignments and teaching of new topics, leaving her to pile it all on the last possible testing day.
