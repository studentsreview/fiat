He explains everything pretty well in his lectures, but you have to take a lot of notes. Doesn't give many tests or homework. Most of your grade is group projects and essays. Offers extra credit if you teach the class for a day. He can get pretty mad sometimes, our class had to write an essay on academic honesty and integrity after he found out someone was giving away answers to quizzes. Highly recommend.

He claims he doesn't like kids, but he will provide support if you need it. All the memorization adds a lot of stress to students' lives though.
