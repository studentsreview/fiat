Her teaching style can be a little confusing before you get used to it, however she will always take the time to help you if you ask and sheâ€™s an amazing one-on-one teacher. She also does a lot of examples as a class which are super helpful. Her tests are really doable if you pay attention in class, theyâ€™re always on things that we actually learned and went over several times. Iâ€™ve never been good at science but I always felt prepared for her tests.

She talks very fast when she is lecturing so lots of people get confused. All you have to do is communicate with her all the time. If she is talking too fast, tell her, she slows down and will do an example on the board. If you don&#x27;t understand a worksheet walk up t and tell her, she will do it with you step by step every time. If you are having trouble grasping a concept, hang around after class, I guarantee that once she&#x27;s done explaining one-on-one you will leave understanding. She is so good at explaining one-on-one. It&#x27;s using this process that my friends and I have done so well in her class while everyone else sat there confused. Also, it&#x27;s through all the one-on-one conversations that we have developed a great relationship with Ms. D.

Her grading feels a little bit disorganized(?) too. Besides that, the class is actually really chill, and if you finish your work fast enough you can get a bunch of extra credit. The homework and tests are easy, but you may need to do a little self studying. She&#x27;s nice and very energetic, and I feel she really likes teaching.

The way she teaches is a little confusing so you sometimes need to ask for clarification. She messes up the grades at least once (corrects it later) and is a little slow with entering them. Her grading feels a little bit disorganized(?) too. Besides that, the class is actually really chill, and if you finish your work fast enough you can get a bunch of extra credit. The homework and tests are easy, but you may need to do a little self studying. She's nice and very energetic, and I feel she really likes teaching. Overall she's an okay teacher where you don't learn as much as other classes, but I recommend taking her if you want an easy A.","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"HORRIBLE teacher, but I guess she is nice when it comes to grading if you beg her. super unorganized, unhelpful, unknowledgeable, and overall is forgetful about students. take her if you're smart/ know you're good at math or physics - you'll get an A. if you have trouble learning physics, avoid.","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i think she's a pretty good teacher. her powerpoints are clear, however she can't always explain it clearly. she's nice and realy wants you to understand the material n makes sure u understand it i'l reccomend her easy B o A","rating":3.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Very unclear.

Her tests are ridiculous. They aren't hard, it's just that she gives SO MANY problems. Enough that you're just barely able to make it before class is over. And that's for long blocks.
