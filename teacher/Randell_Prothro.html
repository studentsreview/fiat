He is such a wonderful person and is more like a friend than a teacher. He tries to make class as interesting as possible but sadly it's still pretty tough if you're not good at sciences. He grades you based off if he thinks you understand the stuff or not and the final and not really the homework (which he asignes only right before tests). Better than Ms. D by far though.","rating":3.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Prothro is the chillest teacher ever and is very laid back. He enjoys nature(that shows with his classroom)and stuff. He doesn't teach as well as Cooley only because his philosophy is that students shouldn't be spoon fed every single piece of information. He believes in being able to problem-solve b/c that's an essential skill in life. Tests are easy if you studied and understood the concepts independently, but hard if you don't do anything in the class and don't enjoy learning physics yourself.","rating":3.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"mr. prothro is awesome!!!! he's such a fun teacher. this one time.. it was super sunny outside and we went out to play ultimate frizbe... he's a pretty good teacher as well.. explains things very well","rating":3.9,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"(AP Physics 1) Prothro's class is super laid-back and he's a great dude. He is very set on the learn-by-doing teaching style and so his labs are great, but his tests are difficult and mostly conceptual which requires a lot of studying.
