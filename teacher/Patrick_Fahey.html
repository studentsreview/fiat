If you self-study, even easier-Bad at lecturing. Because of this, it can be hard to learn from him. Try to avoid if you want to actually learn and go on to calculus.-Never collects homework (although he says he will). He DOES check homework from time to time, but this really depends on his mood.

He cares a lot about his students, and if you talk to him in a small group, it's guaranteed that he'll postpone tests and due-dates, add a curve, or give you an extra chance.

For some reason, his lectures do not really explain anything. He grades your homework on neatness as well.
