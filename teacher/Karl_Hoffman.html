I have never been a math class where I laughed so much. Hoffman, aka Mr. Hoffy, will let you get away with a lot of stuff because although he doesn't seem like it, he does have a pretty good sense of humor. Never collects homework, which is not necessarily a good thing because tests count for 75% of your grade and he places a lot more emphasis on constructions than other teachers. But overall, TAKE HOFFMAN. His tests can be tricky, but just study and review previous problems. =]","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Hoffman is the best for Geo H. I would take him again for AP Cal. You should do your hw even though it is not required. He talks in a monotone voice, but still take him its worth it. Overall, good teacher.

He tells/teaches you all that you need to know to succeed on his tests, so pay attention in class and/or copy down what's on the board. You get a notecard on his tests, so utilize that and STUDY. If you pay attention, do you hw and study, then a B is not too hard. HAve to work for an A. Also, he's a super funny guy and knows people's names really fast.
