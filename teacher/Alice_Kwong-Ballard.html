- Informative lectures
- Prepares you for AP exam

Cons:
- Harsh as fuck with FRQ grading... if you don&#x27;t use a word or sentence structure how she likes it, automatic 0 even if the answer itself is correct
- Picky with binders. Ugly notes? -2. Didn&#x27;t use the right color for shading this part of the diagram? -1.

As long as you pay attention to what she says in the lectures, the tests won&#x27;t be too bad. They&#x27;re pretty straight forward, and tells you exactly how to format the FRQs to make them easier. She usually curves the test by the second highest score, but it sometimes goes lower than that. The way you need to takes notes is a little strict, like every lecture you need to write a summary a certain way. But she&#x27;s really passionate and energetic, and makes class really interesting! She uses some stories for her life as examples for some things which makes it pretty funny too.
