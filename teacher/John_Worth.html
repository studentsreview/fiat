This is the best class I've had so far in Lowell. I learned a lot. Gives an outline first(to take notes keep track)before explaining the lesson. Has tests/quizzes almost every Friday, but it's not impossible to get an A as long as you study your outline or make a reviewer. Website=all the materials.

Class is too unstructured and always goes off track. Lots of unnecessary videos, activities, and assignments that offer no value to the course. Mr. Worth knows a lot and is very insightful, but he doesn't know how to teach an AP class.
