The extra stress from just this one class is not worth it, when it's such a struggle to get an A in his class.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Martin is awesome... if you try... easy B hard A. Daily quizzes but they help. Every week or so you get a project or a packet to read. He really did help the class prepare for the APUSH test... and even was on the spot on what the DBQ was about. Try and work hard ... you should be fine.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"To be honest, Mr. Martin is one of my favorite teachers. He may have hard tests and exams, but he knows what he is talking about. I had him last year for Modern World, and I learned so much. His lectures are meaty and packed full of useful information. I feel like I know so much more, having been in his class. He is such a funny guy, and I am so glad I was able to take his class last year.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr Martin is seriously once of the best teachers you could ever have. He's just bloody amazing. He knows his material, and has had experience teaching in foreign countries, so if you dig someone who knows a lot about the world, then you should take him. He's a pretty easy B, but kind of tough to get an A. However, you learn so much in his class, and he never bores you. TAKE HIM!! HE'S THE BEST!","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I learned a lot this past semester in his class (APWH). Although an A is quite difficult to attain, it is definitely do-able.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Martin is very entertaining and humorous... Easy A if you are willing to work hard and put effort into your work. Daily quizzes given, and current events every week. Tests are moderately hard, know the material besides what is written in the book.Current events incorporated into tests.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Overall, the tests are pretty hard and reading sections every night is annoying, but you'll feel like you're learning. He explains the material well and he's funny. Just study and you should be fine.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i had him for ap world F'08 - S'09. projects were ok, usually maps. daily reading quiz. . . online outlines help somewhat. he's a very funny guy, sometimes sarcastic, but he's pretty cool. he also knows what he's doing with the ap testing, so you get pretty useful tips from him. kind of challenging.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's a really hard teacher, but he's a really great teacher.. and funny too! I love his sarcasm. But he's worth it if you really want to learn, but you got to work hard.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Martin is a really great teacher! I've had him for two semesters now for Modern World. To do well in his class you need to take good notes and listen up to his class lectures. There are daily quizzes, but they help you in the long run. You'll need to study geography a lot. Groupwork, projects, and tests count for most of your grade. The final was crazzzzy hard, but if you study up, you'll do great in his class. He's really funny and his lectures are alright. Overall, great teacher.","rating":4.7,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"SO HARD. SO MUCH WORK. YOU SERIOUSLY DEVOTE YOUR LIFE TO THIS CLASS... BUT! you learn SO much.

Read the section every night, study for a few minutes and you'll be fine (reading a section would be the daily homework assignment). Hilarious jokes. Simple projects.
