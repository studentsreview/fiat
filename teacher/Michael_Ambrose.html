His tests were hard for me even though I studied for hours...so make sure you really KNOW the material. Also, study all the (hard) problems that he assigns for homework. He hardly ever checks homework but do the homework (it'll help on the tests). He also assigns (fun) projects that can raise your grade and his quizes are sometimes easy.
