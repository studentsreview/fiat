Labels each handout with your seat number and hands them out ONE BY ONE, rather than giving each row a stack and letting them self-distribute. Be prepared to stew in frustration as he fritters away class time handing out paper.

Participation matters! You will be expected to contribute a comment or something at least daily. Homework is also almost daily, and he will sign off on it at the beginning of class.

Seconding, he is stingy with As. He is also a slow grader, but that does not translate to a lot of constructive comments.

Prepares you well, essay-wise, for the AP exam, though his pacing through the material is terrible. Lots of prep for the rhetorical analysis essay in the fall (good for SAT essay!), but had not started prep for the synthesis/argument essays by the beginning of March. He does AP multiple-choice practice throughout the year.

Bonus: Easily distracted. Ask about jazz or something 80s and he will tangent.</small></div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12px"><div class="jsx-2747747579 card "><div class="jsx-2956695818 content "><div style="margin-bottom:6px" class="jsx-86683480 row "><div class="jsx-1613785644 anchor"><span class="jsx-2763296875 ">StudentsReview Review</span><sup class="jsx-1613785644"><span style="background-color:#29bc9b" class="jsx-2222040147  ">5<!-- -->/5</span></sup></div><span class="jsx-870436695 "></span><span class="jsx-1942923772 ">4 years ago</span></div><small class="jsx-1522418964  ">If you think Yuan is hard, you are probably not very good at english.
