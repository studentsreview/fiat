If you are a freshman taking him for World, the class is a guaranteed A and will probably be your most enjoyable class.

He is SUPER funny and a great teacher. He may pick on students, but only to be funny, not to hurt anyone. He gives open note quizzes occasionally and his tests are multiple choice. Homework consists of reading/note taking. In class, he gives lectures that are quite interesting. Overall, he is a good teacher. If you want a teacher that's not hard nor easy, take Bell! He's hip!","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had Mr. Bell only one semester for freshman year '13, sadly, but he has been my favorite history teacher of all of the ones I've had at Lowell. I also had him as a mentor for a competition, and inside and outside the class, he's very thoughtful, kind, and insightful in the fields he's studied in (in this case, history). Any question you have, don't hesitate to ask him, because he is certainly more than happy to answer. His lectures are actually enjoyable too. I'd definitely recommend him.Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's awesome \u0026 I'm so sad that he won't be my history teacher again. Lectures can be boring but he has a special glare that motivates you to stay awake. Learned a lot of good information however it was not used in the exam. It's not his fault as the exam was completely revised so no one knew what was coming but I probably got a 2. But Bell is the only Euro teacher so good luck. He seems mean but he just teases \u0026 cares about his students.

Make him like you and don't treat the class like a joke and you'll get an A. He talks about life a lot which is cool but he makes too many generalizations about being a Lowell student that make me want to punch him in the face. Rare homework rare tests. Can be rude to kids he doesn't like but overall a cool and nice guy. Most people will love him but he pissed me off.Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"AP Euro - heavy homework, a fair amount of tests. overall quite good. i was a student in his first ever euro class and despite that he prepared me well enough to get a 5. it's certainly not the easiest class but i definitely recommend itSubmitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"You wont regret it!","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Great teacher. Not always the most approachable (at times), but he will apologize for his mistakes and correct them, and he respects his students. Knows his stuff, knows how to teach, and engages with everyone. Reaches out to students outside of school and the classroom. Overall, helpful, knowledgeable, and a fantastic teacher. Don't take him for an easy A, take him because you love history. But if that's the case, he's one of the best teachers you can take.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"hes a good teacher you'll learn so much. He wants u to think and reason (go deep in the topic) not to memorize it, his humor makes the class feel a bit less stressful and his hw is mostly reading about 5-9 pgs and taking notes and reviewing the vocab and typing why is this vocab important, why does it matter? take him, its so much fun and u learn which is what is expected","rating":4.3,"version":1}],"rating":4.2749999999999995}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/teacher/[name]","query":{"name":"Matthew_Bell"},"buildId":"AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx","assetPrefix":"/fiat","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"head":[["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}],["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["meta",{"name":"description","content":"Archive of Lowell High School teachers and courses"}],["title",{"children":"Matthew Bell"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-4beebf4ac9054f0bf4e6.js"></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/main-f15262772fc97eee50b8.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/framework.9707fddd9ae5927c17c3.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/commons.bb822e7c776bab18628a.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/068c6f53dc68b30736cec27763051c7d543cba78.11c1326bf734c80731d8.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-e506b01f7ea61d647a59.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/29107295.970b1056bd19a488ef12.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/75fc9c18.f19b3b2ac98aa7d8e31a.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/pages/teacher/%5Bname%5D-2e28ecfe836cd9f8279c.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
