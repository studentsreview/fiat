I came from the regular track (geo, adv. algebra) and I&#x27;m doing well. I study 30-60 mins for his tests so its not an easy A if you don&#x27;t study. But hes an amazing teacher and he ACTUALLY TEACHES!!! he makes you understand pre calc! I would definitely take him again b/c he is a wonderful teacher that will prepare me for the finals</small></div></div></div></div></div></main></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"teacher":{"name":"Tom Chan","departments":["Math"],"semesters":["Fall2014","Spring2015","Fall2015","Spring2016","Fall2016","Spring2017","Fall2017","Spring2018","Fall2019","Spring2020","Fall2020","Spring2021"],"classes":[{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"1","semester":"Fall2014"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"7","semester":"Fall2014"},{"name":"Geometry Honors","block":"2","semester":"Fall2014"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"4","semester":"Fall2014"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"6","semester":"Fall2014"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"1","semester":"Spring2015"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2015"},{"name":"Geometry","block":"2","semester":"Spring2015"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"4","semester":"Spring2015"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"6","semester":"Spring2015"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"1","semester":"Fall2015"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"5","semester":"Fall2015"},{"name":"Geometry","block":"2","semester":"Fall2015"},{"name":"Geometry","block":"4","semester":"Fall2015"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2015"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"1","semester":"Spring2016"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"5","semester":"Spring2016"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"7","semester":"Spring2016"},{"name":"Geometry","block":"2","semester":"Spring2016"},{"name":"Geometry","block":"4","semester":"Spring2016"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"1","semester":"Fall2016"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"3","semester":"Fall2016"},{"name":"Algebra 1","block":"2","semester":"Fall2016"},{"name":"Algebra 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2016"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2016"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"1","semester":"Spring2017"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"3","semester":"Spring2017"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2017"},{"name":"Algebra 1","block":"2","semester":"Fall2017"},{"name":"Algebra 1","block":"4","semester":"Fall2017"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"1","semester":"Fall2017"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"3","semester":"Fall2017"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"6","semester":"Fall2017"},{"name":"AP Calculus AB","block":"4","semester":"Spring2018"},{"name":"AP Calculus AB","block":"6","semester":"Spring2018"},{"name":"AP Calculus AB","block":"8","semester":"Spring2018"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"3","semester":"Spring2018"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"6","semester":"Fall2019"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"8","semester":"Fall2019"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"3","semester":"Fall2019"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"5","semester":"Fall2019"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"7","semester":"Fall2019"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"3","semester":"Spring2020"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus","block":"5","semester":"Spring2020"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"6","semester":"Spring2020"},{"name":"Pre-Calculus Honors","block":"7","semester":"Spring2020"},{"name":"Algebra 2","block":"8","semester":"Spring2020"},{"name":"AP Calculus AB","block":"2","semester":"Fall2020"},{"name":"AP Calculus BC","block":"8","semester":"Fall2020"},{"name":"Geometry","block":"7","semester":"Spring2021"},{"name":"AP Calculus AB","block":"2","semester":"Spring2021"},{"name":"AP Calculus BC","block":"8","semester":"Spring2021"}],"reviews":[{"timestamp":"2019-12-01T04:53:11.602Z","text":"Hardest teacher you will have for precalc-h.

Honestly one of the best teachers I've had. Very kind, understanding, and wants the best for you. His class moves quickly and the weekly quizzes are hard, but he really makes sure you know what you're doing. Drops lowest test scores and curves your grade. Also hilarious.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"ive had him freshman year and all junior year. he used to be horrible...but now hes a great teacher. he explains a lot better. i guess it comes with experience. his tests are really hard...no wonder he teaches only honors. hes always there to help. a B is very possible. not sure about that A though...","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Chan is pretty easy if you are good at math. But as a person who isn't very good, all you have to do is pay attention and do all the homework questions to make sure you understand the concepts. The tests are pretty difficult and sometimes he throws in questions that can be tricky. You should be able to get a B or higher if you try. He also helps you one-on-one, which is really helpful because he makes it easy to understand.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I shall miss thee, Chanman!! :( It feels weird not having you for math.

He teaches really good, he explains everything clearly and he doesn't mind to help you after school. His tests are really hard ,as in Accel H, and worth a lot. His quizzes are pretty easy not as hard as his tests. Homework everyday,but he doesn't really check it and he will go over the next day.

I came from the regular track (geo, adv. algebra) and I'm doing well. I study 30-60 mins for his tests so its not an easy A if you don't study.
