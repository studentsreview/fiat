Not much homework &amp; most is easy anyway. He&#x27;s still working out his teaching method (he&#x27;s not used to good schools). Likes group labs &#x27;cause they&#x27;re easy to grade. He doessn&#x27;t believe in orthodox teaching methods like memorization and tries different techniques.

Pretty easy, make sure to do all his hw and labs. we barely have tests so hw/labs make up your grade. he teaches by powerpoint. We only had 3 tests (including the final). \u003c3 this guy!!","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He is an extremely kind teacher who loves his students and teaching. He prioritizes students' interest in the subject more than test scores, so most of his tests are open book or open neighbors. He gives a lot of extra credit opportunities, but if you just listen in class and try on the labs, you won't even need to do them. He will help you whenever you need help. He never gets mad. Lots of field trips, too. Taking his class really made me fall in love with science. 200/10 would recommend.Submitted by a student","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Take his class after 1-2 that way ask your friends what's on the test and always ace it final is comprised of ll test questions so make sure you learn your mistakes labs are easy if you work hard at them","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Overall a good teacher and is usually open to suggestions. For example he let us pick our own groups for group labs. The only thing that isn't great about the class is that there is a lot of writing to the labs, like we always have to write reports. But overall he is a good teacher, knows what he's doing and helps you understand things.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Not that great for bio. Has countless 15-page labs, that aren't effective as he thinks they are. Getting grades back is a hastle. He has an outbox which is basically a tray with a ton of random work that we've done that usually isn't in any particular order. Sometimes you have to ask for tests back because he forgets to return them. Somewhat of a flake. somewhat Easy A though.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I think he's a very good teacher. The discussions we had in class are very interesting and we're always doing stuff. He's definitely not one of those teachers who just reads from a book and makes you write it down.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had him the first semester he was teaching here, I had my doubts in the beginning, but everything turned out pretty cool. As with any other new teacher, he just needs to get used to the \"Lowell environment\" He's super nice and grades fairly, I wish I could take him again but I settled for Melvin since I was last pick anyway","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i LOVE mr laureyns. hes HEKKA COOOL!! hardly and hwk. easy stuff. quizzes every other firday and labs are stinkin easy. never need the book. AWSOME man. really nice to kids. TAKE HIMM!! oh, and no need to participate. EVERRRR. \u003c3 love him. he has an earring too. hahaha but he teaches chapters slwer than others. like a chpt or 2 behind. but hes tight. take him NO DOUBTT","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Cool bio teacher! I loved how he would teach the class using stick people drawings on the board and even that outdoor activity with the transcription/translation process! If you need help on something, he'll help and make everything clearer! He's the type of teacher that makes everything fun and easily understandable. I say the only thing that can be hard in his class are labs, but that only applies when you have to work with some lazy/independent people in your group. Otherwise, easy A. =]","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i jus had a pop quiz this other day with the notes he stole from the internet. sure he gave us the notes but who knew we were supposed to study for it when he gave us the notes a week ago and during that week we were focused on the stupid lab he gave us. more than half of us failed it. and i know i did.. horrible.. he goes, \"its ok, people have their bad days..\" he rushes thru the notes expecting each of us to copy it with the 20 seconds he gives us. i will never take him again.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"lame teacher. no hw, but you have to do a lab in one night. boring class, boring lectures. easy A if u do the lab reports right.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Not a lot of homework, kinda funny, labs are a snoozefest. Doesn't give the lab write ups back to you on tyme. I mean come on we turn our last lab a month ago and he said he isn't going to give them back until we come back to school in jan. But overall he's really easy, tests are great, I think he's the only teacher that does all multiple choice tests. I sooo love that part!!!","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"A lot more hands on activities compared to other classes and he helps you if you need it. even though his tests are somewhat hard, its not hard to get away with an A for the semester","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"cool. he really tries to help you if you don't get it. he makes sure you actually understand the concepts instead of just memorizing vocabulary. pretty easy and straightforward tests, though he sometimes tries to be funny on them (DNA has two basses and a guitar) he enjoys it when people argue in class about science, even if it's among the same three people (everyone else is complaining and wants the pointless debates to end)","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He definitely does not know what he is doing. His PowerPoints consist of information he has taken off the web. His class is pointless and a total bore.","rating":4.1,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"OK teacher. Lots of labs \u0026 most are boring. Has a problem with returning labs on time. Take him if you're a slacker 'cause he's sort of a slacker to. Tries to be funny \u0026 cool. Not much homework \u0026 most is easy anyway. He's still working out his teaching method (he's not used to good schools). Likes group labs 'cause they're easy to grade. He doessn't believe in orthodox teaching methods like memorization and tries different techniques. If you're good at Bio and want to learn more, don't take him.","rating":4.1,"version":1}],"rating":4.100000000000004}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/teacher/[name]","query":{"name":"Shawn_Laureyns"},"buildId":"AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx","assetPrefix":"/fiat","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"head":[["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}],["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["meta",{"name":"description","content":"Archive of Lowell High School teachers and courses"}],["title",{"children":"Shawn Laureyns"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-4beebf4ac9054f0bf4e6.js"></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/main-f15262772fc97eee50b8.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/framework.9707fddd9ae5927c17c3.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/commons.bb822e7c776bab18628a.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/068c6f53dc68b30736cec27763051c7d543cba78.11c1326bf734c80731d8.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-e506b01f7ea61d647a59.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/29107295.970b1056bd19a488ef12.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/75fc9c18.f19b3b2ac98aa7d8e31a.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/pages/teacher/%5Bname%5D-2e28ecfe836cd9f8279c.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
