Easygoing, slightly amusing in the way he composes himself, very knowledgeable about etymology and mythology. Participate in the class discussions and he'll get to know you and you'll learn. Very approachable for questions or feedback outside of class time if you want to improve your writing. Little homework, just study questions that he doesn't care if it's on time but rather you understand the material, quizzes based on the questions, about 2 big in-class essay tests per semester.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-04-20T07:32:27.141Z","text":"very hard to stay awake in his class but has a great sense of humor. essays are very harshly graded at least from my experience. all you do is copy his notes. 08/10 personality, 03/10 for his ways of teaching","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Boring class.
