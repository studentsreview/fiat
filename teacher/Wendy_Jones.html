All the people who say she plays favorites and is not helpful are WRONG. Ask her a question. ANY question. She will answer, and be happy to. She loves people who try in dance.

I don't know if she plays favorites. I'm only in her beginning dance class. But she doesn't know people's names and I wish she would try harder to remember everyone. I understand that there are a lot of students in her classes, but other teachers with as much students manage to know everyone's name. Since she doesn't know ppl in class and we don't have any homeowrk assignments, I'm not sure how she grades but she gave everyone an A-","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I took one semester of beginners dance. It's not easy for Ms. Jones to teach and choreograph for so many classes and organize a concert by herself. In class, She would show us the movements/stretches/dances and we would just imitate her. Easy A, VERY easy A, as long as you participate.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I love Ms.Jones! She has a slight temper, but that's b/c she takes dance VERY seriously. B/c so, she'll only take you seriously if YOU'RE serious and hard working about dance. Doesn't choose favorites, she just likes seeing hard work, dedication, and improvement. Respect the class and the art, she'll respect you. Her mom, who sadly passed away, taught her dance, so imagine her passion. Believe it or not, she actually knows all students' names.

She is so nice and fun and I look forward to dance more than any other class in the day. If she tells you that you're not ready for advanced, its not because she doesn't like you, its because she's a professional dance teacher and she knows from watching you every day whether you're ready or not. Just try hard and have enthusiasm and fun!Submitted by a student","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Easy A. Beg. Dance, just follow what she does and she won't correct you or give you a bad grade. I've been late to class so many times, and she didn't mark me absent. Towards the middle to the end of the semester, the class gets boring and you start to lose motivation to go.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"i love mrs.jones! she's really funny and she's always making jokes to our class (usually dance related of course). just show up dressed and with a positive attitude to work hard and dance! if she doesn't know your name, don't worry, it's not like she hates you or anything.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Class is fun and easy.

She doesn't play favorites at all! As long as you try and you work hard she will like you.

Her class is pretty easy and chill and its true she doesn't get to know any of the kids, probably only if you're good. Has a temper. In beg. dance, she didn't even try to correct you if you do something wrong. She just lets u do w.e","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I look forward to having dance ever day. It's the best class ever. In adv. dance, we actually have some book work. Mostly taking notes and writing about some dances. It's to benefit us in the future so we never forget what we learned.

And all of you who says she plays favoritism, it's just because you thought that you can take dance and not try hard and still get an A to add to your perfect GPA. If you take dance you have to be open to it and try as hard as you would in any other class.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Jones is the best. She plays favorites though :[ Her dance class is awesome. You learn and perfect your turns and etc, and you have fun.

However, in the beginning of the year at back to school night for the parents, one parent asked what was required for advanced dance and she said she would make it clear and teach us what we needed to know. I WAS THERE. Guess what? She didn't. overall, ok. dance :)","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"gave me a B for no reason at all, when the whole class got an A. loses her temper very easily.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Jones is very helpful \u0026 nice.

I love Ms. Jones, sure she may play favorites, but you don't have to be on company for her to like you.

She tries to help everyone improve, but its hard when there are 40 kids in her class. her choreography is really amazing and she doesn't just choreograph for one specific dance style; she varies from modern, jazz, ballet, and contemporary. If you hadn't taken dance before like me, she'll totally help you improve, and she cares a lot about studenta in all of her classes.","rating":4.3,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"She's a really good dance teacher and teaches a lot of styles.

Ms. Jones usually only accepts people who has had previous dance experience in her dance company. You should only consider auditioning if you are currently taking dance. If you don't she will cut you out for the second part of dance company tryouts. do a whole year of dance. However some people DO make company without taking dance/previous experience but this won't happen that often. Sorry to say of the sad truth.","rating":4.3,"version":1}],"rating":4.264444444444447}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/teacher/[name]","query":{"name":"Wendy_Jones"},"buildId":"AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx","assetPrefix":"/fiat","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"head":[["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}],["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["meta",{"name":"description","content":"Archive of Lowell High School teachers and courses"}],["title",{"children":"Wendy Jones"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-4beebf4ac9054f0bf4e6.js"></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/main-f15262772fc97eee50b8.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/framework.9707fddd9ae5927c17c3.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/commons.bb822e7c776bab18628a.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/068c6f53dc68b30736cec27763051c7d543cba78.11c1326bf734c80731d8.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-e506b01f7ea61d647a59.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/29107295.970b1056bd19a488ef12.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/75fc9c18.f19b3b2ac98aa7d8e31a.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/chunks/pages/teacher/%5Bname%5D-2e28ecfe836cd9f8279c.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/fiat/_next/static/AN0DODvOoh_K9fPEFoFxx/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
