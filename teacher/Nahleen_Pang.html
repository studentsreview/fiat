I have had her for about a year and I haven't had much trouble besides on the cumulative test. If you turn in all your homework, participate (tough in participation grades), and do bad on the test, then there's a possibility that you can get a B/C in her class. In her class you don't learn much sentence structure or have dictation on the test but only vocabulary. I think it's easier to get a good grade that way. She's not a flaming hell.

However, just live with it. There's no point in complaining so just study as if it was any other class and try your best. She will give you an A if you ace all your tests. Even though she does judge you by your skits, just spend time rehearsing and writing your script. People complain because many students are shy and have trouble performing.
