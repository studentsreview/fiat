I'm talking about 1% from a D. So, at arena, I chose Ms. Rotter instead. It was the best choice I've made. Her class isn't too bad, except there is a lot of homework. However, it is easy to get a A/B if you complete all her rlogs, labs, and worksheets while getting Cs on tests and quizzes. I currently have an A in her class because of this. Just pay attention and take notes and complete homework.","rating":3.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"If you have no chance of taking Fong, then just don't even consider taking chem at all. Rotter doesn't teach for god's sake, and she expects you to learn everything from you homework-which is just reading the textbook. She makes you lug around a good 10 pound notebook that you have to make \"colorful.\" A good portion of your grade depends on that thing so... Effort. There is material on the test that she has never taught-which means, hooray beautiful test scores! Just don't. You'll regret it.","rating":3.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"The class is slower paced than Trimble's but you'll learn just as much. Rotter is much more relaxed and approachable than Trimble is. The work is never back breakingly hard or too much because it will often be a continuation from topics discussed in class, but make sure to keep up your notebook! Also, she is very thorough with grading and reads everything that you write. make sure to definitely put in the work.Submitted by a student","rating":3.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"MS. ROTTER IS AMAZING. her notes are way more helpful than the book, she's willing to help you if you're struggling, everything she teaches is direct, and she is SO COOL :D. take her! the rlogs preambles aren't even that bad.. ya'll needa chill","rating":3.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"This class is an easy A if you just do the homework.

The notebook is worth much more then the quizzes so as long as it's neat and complete (and colorful) you should be fine if you bomb a quiz.

Over the years, the work has been sharply decreasing, and now i can call the amount of hw i have from her manageable. Plus a lot of people forgot the upside of the homework-it helps your grade if you bomb the tests! (which really aren't that hard either). Lectures are alright, teaches by powerpoint.

She assigns a strenuous amount of work. In fact, she assigned more work than my two AP classes combined!! If you're not into chemistry, and are not ready to work your tail off, do not take Ms. Rotter. Believe me, you will hate your life so much. Keeping up w/ her futile notebook assignments, especially her reading logs, were the worst. I'm sorry to say this, but I've never hated a class like this -- but that's probably just me b/c I hate science.","rating":3.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"took trimble first semester for reg chem and got a C. Rotter is better bc she has more assignments. She does assign way too many nb assignments, to get an R or N (95% or 100%), you must wirte a lot, being specific and colorful. Tests are pretty hard but can be retaken for a 75%. pretty easy B but a hard A. I had an A for much of the semester but her final dropped it to a B. I wish i had taken her for chem H, because its about the same as her regular class, and its weighted.
