I had him for AP english but he doesn&#x27;t really teach. If you take AP because you&#x27;re not a strong writer but are looking to improve, don&#x27;t take him. If you&#x27;re going to ace the AP exam regardless, he&#x27;s awesome. His stories are epic. Most classes you can either participate or space out (but don&#x27;t fall asleep or he&#x27;ll throw a beanie baby at you). He gives pop quizzes, but if you read the book you&#x27;re fine. Most books in his course are cool. Essays are graded fairly, but whether they&#x27;re graded in a fair amount of time is another story. Hardest part is in-class essays: he gives 3 prompts for you to prepare notes for and rolls a dice the day of to determine which one you&#x27;ll write in 45 min. If this scares you, check what the AP test is for this course before signing up. I&#x27;d recommend ONLY if you&#x27;re already a confident writer. I&#x27;d definitely recommend him for a non-AP class like film as lit; it&#x27;s a shame he doesn&#x27;t teach it anymore.</small></div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12px"><div class="jsx-2747747579 card "><div class="jsx-2956695818 content "><div style="margin-bottom:6px" class="jsx-86683480 row "><div class="jsx-1613785644 anchor"><span class="jsx-2763296875 ">StudentsReview Review</span><sup class="jsx-1613785644"><span style="background-color:#29bc9b" class="jsx-2222040147  ">1<!-- -->/5</span></sup></div><span class="jsx-870436695 "></span><span class="jsx-1942923772 ">4 years ago</span></div><small class="jsx-1522418964  ">He&#x27;s pretty good for AP Art History but pick another teacher for AP Lang/Comp. </small></div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12px"><div class="jsx-2747747579 card "><div class="jsx-2956695818 content "><div style="margin-bottom:6px" class="jsx-86683480 row "><div class="jsx-1613785644 anchor"><span class="jsx-2763296875 ">StudentsReview Review</span><sup class="jsx-1613785644"><span style="background-color:#29bc9b" class="jsx-2222040147  ">1<!-- -->/5</span></sup></div><span class="jsx-870436695 "></span><span class="jsx-1942923772 ">4 years ago</span></div><small class="jsx-1522418964  ">How is Ritter getting all these good reviews, like actually he was so mean to our class.

I had a great time in Ritter&#x27;s AP Lang/Comp class. He gave a lot of pop quizzes, but you could easily do well on them if you&#x27;ve read the book or looked at the sparknotes before class. He allowed us to use our notes during the quizzes as well, so you should have no problem if you put in a little effort. I think he graded the essays fairly, and he puts criticism throughout the paper to help you improve your writing. I do think that you have to be a decent writing before taking his class to do well though. He gave/taught us a whole packet of literary devices that could&#x27;ve potentially been on the AP exam, timed essays that we could prepare for beforehand, and advice on taking the exam. Anyways, he&#x27;s a chill guy and the class itself&#x27;s a little boring, but he was helpful in preparing us for the AP exam.</small></div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12px"><div class="jsx-2747747579 card "><div class="jsx-2956695818 content "><div style="margin-bottom:6px" class="jsx-86683480 row "><div class="jsx-1613785644 anchor"><span class="jsx-2763296875 ">StudentsReview Review</span><sup class="jsx-1613785644"><span style="background-color:#29bc9b" class="jsx-2222040147  ">1<!-- -->/5</span></sup></div><span class="jsx-870436695 "></span><span class="jsx-1942923772 ">4 years ago</span></div><small class="jsx-1522418964  ">Bad teacher.

As someone said before, he&#x27;s not the fastest grader. 90% of the days in class we read the book. The other 10% is watching a movie related to said book (which I think are actually pretty interesting). You also need to recite a sonnet twice in the course of the semester. For essay&#x27;s, you have a choice on which book you want to write on (for me it was Midsummer or Hamlet). We&#x27;re also going to have an in-class essay on King Lear (not so excited for that). But he&#x27;s super chill, really easy to talk to and also very nice to everyone. He also has a good sense of humor! Also the class is a little slow but that&#x27;s to be expected. 
Overall an easy A with almost no homework, and I definitely recommend him if you want a chill teacher.</small></div></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12px"><div class="jsx-2747747579 card "><div class="jsx-2956695818 content "><div style="margin-bottom:6px" class="jsx-86683480 row "><div class="jsx-1613785644 anchor"><span class="jsx-2763296875 ">RateMyTeachers Review</span><sup class="jsx-1613785644"></sup></div></div><small class="jsx-1522418964  ">Treats everyone with respect when they deserve it.

I had him for AP english but he doesn't really teach. If you take AP because you're not a strong writer but are looking to improve, don't take him. If you're going to ace the AP exam regardless, he's awesome. His stories are epic. Most classes you can either participate or space out (but don't fall asleep or he'll throw a beanie baby at you). He gives pop quizzes, but if you read the book you're fine. Most books in his course are cool. Essays are graded fairly, but whether they're graded in a fair amount of time is another story. Hardest part is in-class essays: he gives 3 prompts for you to prepare notes for and rolls a dice the day of to determine which one you'll write in 45 min. If this scares you, check what the AP test is for this course before signing up. I'd recommend ONLY if you're already a confident writer. I'd definitely recommend him for a non-AP class like film as lit; it's a shame he doesn't teach it anymore.","rating":3,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-04T22:09:55.716Z","text":"He's pretty good for AP Art History but pick another teacher for AP Lang/Comp.

I had a great time in Ritter's AP Lang/Comp class. He gave a lot of pop quizzes, but you could easily do well on them if you've read the book or looked at the sparknotes before class. He allowed us to use our notes during the quizzes as well, so you should have no problem if you put in a little effort. I think he graded the essays fairly, and he puts criticism throughout the paper to help you improve your writing. I do think that you have to be a decent writing before taking his class to do well though. He gave/taught us a whole packet of literary devices that could've potentially been on the AP exam, timed essays that we could prepare for beforehand, and advice on taking the exam. Anyways, he's a chill guy and the class itself's a little boring, but he was helpful in preparing us for the AP exam.","rating":5,"version":0},{"timestamp":"2020-05-02T04:42:08.009Z","text":"Bad teacher.

As someone said before, he's not the fastest grader. 90% of the days in class we read the book. The other 10% is watching a movie related to said book (which I think are actually pretty interesting). You also need to recite a sonnet twice in the course of the semester. For essay's, you have a choice on which book you want to write on (for me it was Midsummer or Hamlet). We're also going to have an in-class essay on King Lear (not so excited for that). But he's super chill, really easy to talk to and also very nice to everyone. He also has a good sense of humor! Also the class is a little slow but that's to be expected. \nOverall an easy A with almost no homework, and I definitely recommend him if you want a chill teacher.","rating":4,"version":0},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Treats everyone with respect when they deserve it.
