Her exam questions are irrelevant in regards to main ideas from the textbook and she does not go over things during class, as usually trails off or focuses on one certain point way too long.

No.) She's also very rude and stubborn she doesn't take advice at all.","rating":4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Great teacher, great class.
