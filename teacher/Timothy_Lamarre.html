I learned nothing from him because he makes the students run the class. He always either has class discussions or group discussions. One of the books we read wasn't even funny. Sometimes lots of hw, sometimes none. He ruined a class that I thought I was going to be fun","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"a great guy","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"as everyone else said, he is the most intelligent teacher I have ever had in my life. he's laid back, cool, and he's helped me a lot on my essay.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"he teaches you a lot however he is slighty boring while he does so. you just have to be willing to take notes on EVERYTHING he say and he grade really harsh. you have to work extreamly hard for a A or B. hes good if your up for a challenge to learn a lot.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"mr lamarre was the coolest english teacher EVER!!! had him for world lit and expo, and he's really easy. world lit was the best i've ever had because we played games and cracked jokes all throughout class...we had poetry days, watched movies, and played different getting-to-know-you games. i OWNED his participation sheet...haha.","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He's a pretty good teacher but his grading system is harsh (one of my fav teachers)","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"laid back","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Mr. Lamarre is a funny, laid back kind of teacher. He hates grading, so don't expect your test/essays to be returned to you for at least two months. His classes are extremely chill and there is not a lot of homework. He expects the students to work hard and independently, so be prepared to get a C on your essay without much help/explanatation. Tests are easy if you study the vocab and there is no final in the class. Good class if you don't expect an A.Submitted by a student","rating":4.4,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"One of the best teachers a student could ask for.

He's a great teacher - one of the few that can teach at Lowell. The class is straightforward - do well on the tests and the essays, do the credit, come to class, and you'll do fine. His class is no cakewalk - he will destroy your essay - but it'll make you a better writer. He also focuses on analysis and discussion. Somewhat easy B, extremely hard A. But take him - even if you get a B, its worth it!
