By far one my favorites! She's very relatable as she attended Lowell herself and she is super young. She is so nice and incredibly knowledgeable. She runs out quickly during arena, but if you get her you are in luck! Miss.Yu rocks!Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"If you are reluctant on taking Ms. Yu because you read a few negative reviews below, don't be! She's one of the best English teachers I've had. Learned a lot about how to write good essays and how to analyze the text better. Her class is laptop based, so it's tempting to go on MySpace or whatever. She's also a really chill teacher since she's young and went to Lowell before, so she understands your struggle. Had a lot of fun talking about other random topics too. Take her!Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"MS YU IS THE BEST. I love how she teaches and how we use computers everyday to take notes. When we have to write an essay, she prepares us so much that it's hard to get less than a B+. If you need help, she will take the time to help you. She is by far the best English teacher I've ever had.","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Ms. Yu is a hard grader on essays and they are worth 80% of your final grade.

Very knowledgeable but she talks so fast. You can never keep up with her. Grade is mainly based on whether she likes you or not. Her class is teaching lies.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"There isn't much homework, basically no tests, and overall the class is pretty easy. However, if you want to actually learn do not take her. We wrote an essay on Romeo and Juliet despite barely reading the book. Instead we watched the movie and were expected to write an essay on it. She has not finished grading the essays and theres a week left of school. She rants a lot about random things and most of the time she contradicts herself and her facts are incorrect.Submitted by a student","rating":4.2,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Pretty low-stress class, two essays all semester, easy to get along with- basically the dream English teacher.
