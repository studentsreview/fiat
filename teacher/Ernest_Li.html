His class is not boring, and if you listen (like in any other class)you really will learn the material. Homework is average; you'll get a little every night... nothing too tough. You can eat in class, though he might occasionally ask you to put your food away. Most importantly, he's a teacher who wants his students to learn. And here's proof that he's a nice guy: On the last day of school he bought Krispy Kremes for everyone!!!C","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Funny guy haha not really?

Medium amount of homework, but he ever collects. His tests are pretty hard, but if you prepare beforehand, you'll ace it. Plus, he's really chill, kinda funny, nice.

Really funny. Class moves pretty fast and is challenging (especially first semester) but if you stay on top of your work and ask him questions personally you'll be fine. Hard tests but an A is definitely possible if you study. He also finishes the course material early and gives you a head start on calc the first concepts of calc.Submitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"he's not funny","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He is cool, I will definently take him next semester.

Seriously though, I had him for Algebra 1 and he's a good teacher. His assignments are easy, he explains the lesson well, and his tests aren't anything to really stress about. If you get stuck he'll help you. Basically his class is go in, goes over the homework, teaches the lesson, and then let's you work on the homework in class and wanders around to help anyone.Submitted by a student","rating":4.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"He seems friendly enough...much more interesting than warshaw...but he seems a little unpredictable.

Only downside is that he grades tests as 80% of your grade, so if you get a B you're basically screwed. About 1-2 tests per six weeks.
