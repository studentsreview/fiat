I was a senior when I took AP Chem so I didn't take it very seriously or put in a lot of work at home, but I was still able to do well on the AP test just from his lectures and what I learned in class. I don't think I fully appreciated how good of a teacher Mr. Fong was until I took Chem in college this year. He was way better at explaining concepts than my professor and I rely heavily on what I learned in his class.Submitted by a student","rating":4.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"I had Mr.Fong for regular chem and it was super fun and I learned a lot.If you participate, you get extra credit every time you answer a question correct.And Mr.Fong is super nice and funny, and if you have questions, he's always there to help.","rating":4.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"buddy is super chill. he always says hi to me in the hallways and helps me out with my schedule when my other counselor can't or won't help meSubmitted by a student","rating":4.8,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"One of the best science teachers in the whole department!

I'm taking AP Chem right now and it's super fast paced. He gives out homework and do nows on topics we haven't even touched on yet. Can be really frustrating.
