When approached on any issues you have with class, she immediately gets defensive and accusatory. She cannot grade. She picks favorites constantly.When she recognizes that she has done something wrong, she says something along the lines of \"Oh, I should probably do this that way, but oh well.\" Recently, she said in class that \"there shouldn't be one person in the room disseminating all the information.\" If i was not mistaken, that is supposed to be her job.","rating":2.5,"version":1},{"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","text":"Such an easy A as long as you try even a little, you get what you give. Yes she does sort of play favorites, so simply just be pleasant and nice. That's it. Not the best teacher, because her method of teaching is very unique, but effective nonetheless.
